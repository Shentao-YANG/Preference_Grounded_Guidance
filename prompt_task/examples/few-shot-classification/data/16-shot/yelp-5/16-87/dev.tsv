I love the food & coffee here. The owner & staff are always friendly, and love to chat. I've sampled most of the menu, and have yet to be disappointed.\n\nThere are tables, power outlets, & wifi, which makes for a good place to stop in for a few hours & work. (Just don't be a wifi-freeloader, the coffee gods will smite you!)\n\nThe only real \"con\" is their hours. I would love to be able to stop by on my way home & grab a cup of coffee, but they close so early :(	3
What a great little bar, this will be another Arcadia success story. However, I don't like having to leave my drink inside just to go for a smoke. A tiny patio in the back with a table or two for drinks would be fine.	3
Head a 3 hour layover in Pheonix the other week... Hung out here for about a half an hour before it closed.  Decent place... missed the food though.  The bartender was pretty funny... I do like a good sense of humour.  Selection was pretty weak, but what can you expect from an airport bar.  It was still a nice change of pace from the terminal bars.	3
The original BevMo in the valley, if memory serves me well here.  Selection is better than some of the other locations and service has never been a problem for me.  Convenient location not far off the I-10 on the north side of the road.	3
After passing by several times and hearing about the ice cream macrons I decided to go in today to try one with my daughter. Very nice, friendly service and the macarons were delicious!!! I will definitely be back to try their food and for more macaron ice cream sandwiches!	3
Great Espresso and everything a coffee house should be. I only tried the espresso for a quick fuel up. It was perfect and kept me going all day .	3
Bad location. Good icecream!	3
It's a good place to go and eat with friends... The shrimp is juicy but I wish it would have just a bit more flavor...	3
Best place for lunch. for $8.95 you get soup,salad, large plate of your choice of rolls and a dessert. Service is great	3
Its now at the Southpoint Casino. I got to eat here twice on a comp.\nOtherwise i would not justify the cost of $400 for two people that does not include tip.\n\nthe first time i went there i had lobster, its a very nice restaurant with great service. The lobster was huge must have been 5 pounds at least.\n the second time i went i had the Chateaubriand which was very good.\n\nI recommend Michaels only for very special occasions unless you have deep pockets. But its worth the experience	3
Had great service just like all the cold stones I've been to. But I don't come to cold stone very often because it's over priced.	3
Real Mexican Fast Food! It was really good but still not as good as Plaza Mexico in Eastpointe, Michigan. I got a burrito and rice. The people were nice. I bought 4 25 cent mustaches from the toy coin machine. Hit the spot.	3
Def a good scene to have in Vegas that offers locals a different option other than he strip or locals casino. Hipster vibe, good beer selection.	3
Had a great time!! Music was pumping and the crowd came to party. Will be definitely coming back	3
Freakin' expensive and worth it.  The wine stweard and bartender were very knowledgable and fun.	3
Ordered the shrimp cocktail for starters at lunch, and it was absolutely delicious!  The shrimp were sweet and cold, the cocktail sauce had just the right spice to it ~ thoroughly enjoyed and will be returning soon!  The rest of the meal was good, like the refried beans were very tasty.....saw other dishes being served and they all looked and smelled great.  Prices were very reasonable, everything was clean.	4
Florists can be a huge gamble but this one delivered the same day I ordered and the flowers were incredible. Very fresh and lasted for a week. I will definitely use them again and recommend them to you.	4
Always great service and GREAT BREAD!!!! Staff is always friendly and offers generous sized samples. Monkey bread is amazing, and my new favorite is their white chocolate blueberry french bread! This place is my new weekly stop! Highly recommend stopping by and picking up a sample!	4
Enjoyed my visit to V-Nails for mani and pedi.  The hot stone massage offered as part of the pedicure is very nice.  I do not have to travel as far for my bi-weekly session. Great technician.  Mindy is awesome!  and everyone in the shop that I have talked to is very friendly.  Nice place!	4
Used the same car wash after an oil change the car wash was free and the owner actually vacuumed and made sure that everything was satisfactory	4
Simply the best upscale-ish Japanese dining in LV. I'm always excited to have the Omekase here. \nI would even go as far as saying that Raku beats Donguri, one of my fave upscale-ish Japanese restaurants on Manhattan's Upper East Side.	4
Excellent food\ni love Lamb Chops\nVery clean and lovely service\nFast delivery \nThank you Guys  keep going	4
My husband and I went here twice on our Vegas honeymoon we loved this deli so much! The manager was so personable and we chatted him up about football, food and being newlyweds! The food is phenomenal and literally made us come back the next evening before our Ron Show. If you are looking for a fun atmosphere, something a little different than a buffet, best deli food ever and great friendly staff this is a must check in!	4
This place is a hidden treasure!\nIt doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is very cute.I was in Thailand last summer and the food in here tastes just like the ones in Thailand.\nThe most expensive food in the menu is 11.50$ and they have great selection for 7-8$\nI know I will be there soon again!	4
If your looking for something different and new try this place! I eat here once a month at least. The shrimp ceviche is bomb! Not to pricy for the food and a good spot to have some drinks too! It's not a Scottsdale spot so don't expect the world! Try it u won't be upset	4
This was our first time here. I looked up good local eats in Las Vegas and this popped up. Definitely love this place! Especially for the price and the quality of sandwiches. We tried the Reuben-ish and the chicken sandwiches. They were delicious! This is my go to spot for sandwiches now! :)	4
Thank you Pablo for the wonderful experience you provided to Emilio & I. We were both very pleased with the service. We'll be back!	4
I have been here a few times for the hot coffee.  They have organic beans and brew it while you wait.  I have been trying a different selection of beans each visit--hoping to find a favorite.  You can text them your order if you are in a hurry and pick it up in the drive thru.	4
I really don't know why some people have given this place such bad reviews. Picky eaters maybe? I have tried Chinese food in NY, NJ and most places in Charlotte and this is one of the top Chinese places in my book. Fast delivery, food is great. This is more of a takeout/delivery place so don't expect 5 star restaurant treatment when you go for dine in. You will get paper plates and plastic utensils. By the way, you have to order the general tsao's wings and they usually have a coupon online.	4
The best poke ever tasted outside of Hawaii (except for mom's, of course).  After sampling a few kinds of poke, ordered the salmon w/special sauce, limu ahi, chili limu ahi, wasabi ahi and tako pokes, all super fresh and very ono!  Stop by 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate a few doors down for the gohan and anything else to complete your lunch or dinner....they are ohana so it's all good.  And for dessert, try the green apple slushy with ice cream, you won't regret it!	4
I bring my Chevy here to be serviced & they always do a great job.  Jon is my service advisor & he is honest & so helpful!  He's really a great guy & will take care of you.  I recommend him all the time!	4
I am a little less than impressed with this one. No, the service is great, and it has good screenings like all the Odeon ones. It just lacks character and well, there aren't that many screenings of the blockbusters you want to see. Instead it focuses on one and shows far too many shows of it instead of spreading the weight a little. \n\nOn a road that has two independent cinemas up the street, this one falls fairly flat. But here you will find screenings of Sex and the City 2 and other rom coms and big buck movies,  unlike further up the street.	1
I really wanted to to try this place after it was recommended by some friends. We came here last week only to find out that it was closed.  Apparently they are changing locations and judging by most of the comments, I'd say it is a smart move.\n\nI look forward to trying it at their next location.	1
We had Thanksgiving dinner at The Keg and normally I really like that restraint but not this time.  We had 3:30 reservations and did not receive any food until 5:00.  The food was tasteless, bland, not good.  I gave 2 starts because the staff worked so hard and were all extremely friendly.  Even the manager was serving drinks and running food.  But as for the food it self, we could of probably got a better dinner at Denny's.	1
No you don't have to be a member (you just don't have to wait in as big of a line if you are). Restaurant by day and mini club by night. Its in a cool location at the top of Mandalay and the views are great. Same as every other high end lounge in Vegas, the sky is the limit on what you can spend here and the dancing and place does not even think about getting going tell 12ish. The few times I have been here I have never seen a decent bartender, they hire for looks not talent or serving speed, basically service sucks and nothing with kill you buzz as fast as having to wait 10 minutes for a drink.	1
I don't get it, I remember the good ol TCBY frozen yogurt. Creamy and smooth, real flavors.  This stuff melts weird in your mouth and the flavors all taste artificial and the same in a weird way.  So over priced.  The only good thing was how nice they are, really good customer service.	1
The combos were over priced as in are we in a foreign country which devalues the American Dollar? Oh no, we are in Vegas, and an airport nonetheless. The fries were fresh but tasteless cafeteria style and the dining areas were filthy.Burger was pretty standard.	1
This restaurant has been a family favourite for many years but recent visits have been disappointing.  The pasta sauce was sciupata (bland) and noodles overcooked.  Don't get the feeling that there are many Italians in the kitchen.	1
I got the Pad Thai lunch special. It comes with soup, an egg roll, some wonton chips, and a soda. The price was good, but the food was not. The Pad Thai tasted funny. There was some weird after taste; I couldn't figure it out. There were no extra napkins so I had to grab one off the neighboring table. I also ordered the Thai Iced Coffee and it was very sweet. I have this place two stars because of the price. Maybe something else on the menu would taste better, but I'm not willing to try this restaurant again.	1
I love to bake so I love going to bakeries and checking them out. Seeing Buddy on tv led me to believe that his pastries would be top notch since he always seemed so caught up on quality on his shows. The pastries were very over priced (I paid $21 for a small canoli, a cookie, a Napoleon, and a lobster tail) and were a bit of a disappointment. They seemed a little soggy and not fresh. Honestly, not worth going to.	1
The average tasting sushi and friendly service was totally undone by the nearly hour long wait to get our food after ordering. The place isn't very big and was not busy when we place our order so the wait, in my opinion, was totally unjustified. \nNice, clean and fairly priced...but way too slow.	1
The turkey sandwich tasted great!! The service was nice and prompt. Well priced as well. \nWhy the two stars? My husband and I felt sick to our stomachs after eating it. Didn't throw up but felt like it.	1
I wanted to like this place... but yuck. I could smell the old, nearly rotten oil when we walked in the door and I kept hoping I was maybe imaging it. We ordered to-go and when we got home, I couldn't eat the burger and the fries didn't taste good due to the bad oil. Only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the kids working there were really trying hard to impress and do a good job.	1
Service was ok but not inviting. The country fried steak was terrible. We also has the BLT sandwich which was good. The fries and hash browns were plain. They have a cheap lunch menu but I will not return to try it.	1
Holy crap, out of all restaurant I picked this place. \n\nFood: the Mongolian rice was hard and the veges was not cooked at all. Orange chicken was so nasty, it should be called bell pepper chicken not orange. \n\nSerivce: let's say the girl was not very responsive.  But I do give 2 stars for the manager being so polite and letting us know how everything worked. \n\nOverall I probably would not be returning.	1
Asian dishes might be good but do not get the sushi. Made me sick! Will not go back here again.	1
Must have gone on an off night. Have heard good things about the pizza here, and really wanted to like it, but the pizza dough, sauce and (veggie) toppings were all completely bland and tasteless :(\nYMMV...	1
Have you watched Magic Mike? Well this is exactly like that, in the sense that there is not enough stripping and way too much dancing. \n\nThere has to be much more shaking the booty in a thong. \n\nThere was one guy who shook his booty a lot but he was kinda older... aka not really eye candy.\n\nI guess if you want to go to a male dance show, this will fit your needs, but if you're looking for something a little more raunchy, skip this show.\n\nIf a guy paid $50ish to see females doing what these guys did, the guys would riot.	0
I thought this was going to be unbelievable food boy was I disappointed.  It taste like someone opened a can of Chef Boyardee/	0
Unsanitary.  Get in the hot tub and look up.  Enough said.  Pedi/mani was mass market.  How on earth does this place keep ranking #1 in the country when they don't keep up with the green growth on their ceiling.	0
Don't you dare come here! I know lobster is expensive but come on, I expect to be full after having a lobster roll and bisque. \n\nMy girl was dissapointed as hell. REALLY! The bisque was blah, the bread was stale and the roll was done in two bites. There goes $33\n\nPlus there is no real seating area, just small tables next to the noisy Fat Tuesday's bar!\n\n\n\nTheir customer service looked like they were lost and didn't care! \n\nSKIP IT PLEASE!	0
With the attitude that the staff has with their customers, I'm not sure how they've been in business this long. Their food is good but the times that I have gone there the customer service is pretty horrible to say the least. The kid that runs the pick up counter not once, not twice but every singe time throws the receipt at me. No thank you, no smile, no nothing! Horrible service from the entire staff!!	0
I came here to see  the comedy show of Vinnie Favorito with friends from out of town, we got there 30 minutes before the show and we were told there where no\nseats available, the woman at the door started to push us out saying sorry no more seats go get a refund? very disappointing and upsetting because I was told great things  about Vinnie Favorito show. Shame for the flamingo management for  overselling tickets. I did got my money back and bad flavor for the Flamingo Hotel.	0
Guess JITB is afraid of what people will say of the one they have on  West Blvd.\nWent to the one on West Blvd about a week ago , have not been in about 6 or 8 months, see thing never change, gangsta wannabes hanging out in dining area, management seems not to care, or are they intimadated by the GWB's Food was cold and greasy.....This time I will stay away......	0
The prices at this place are ridiculous. They charge $4.50 for 1 pancake and the quality is sub-standard, several tiers below grocery store pancake mix; in the category of a failed home cooking experiment. Even if I was a billionaire I couldn't eat here as it would entail a contradiction; you don't get what you pay for, plain and simple.  \n\nIt's a sad state when the supply and demand market equilibrium of the Mesa restaurant economy allows this place to stay in business; perhaps people in Mesa, AZ have low culinary standards, but I think people should demand more for their money.	0
Bag was stolen by a store employee while I sat and listened to my iPad eating lunch. Caught on video, store manager and owner covering up the situation. Police are now involved and detective investigating the video. Store employee never reported anything to a manager and cleaned out my bag in a cleaning closet in the store. \n\nHomeless use this location as a sanitation station. Be prepared to be asked several times for money. \n\nHomeless change clothes right in the store.	0
Waited 40 minutes with no apologies or explanation. So obnoxious.  Walked out and will NEVER return. There are far too many other restaurants in town with stellar service that we will choose to spend our money.	0
The one bouncer refused to let me in because I was wearing sneakers.  I had on nice jeans and a nice polo shirt and was dressed better than 90% of the guys in there.  I was also with three women and was their DD.  They still wouldn't let me in when we told them that.  I eventually snuck in even though I didn't want to go.  It was my friend's birthday and that is the only reason I went.  I'll never go back to a place who won't let in a DD.	0
The staff is super unfriendly and they close an hour earlier than the time they're supposed to close (for example: they close at 8 pm when the sign says they close at 9 pm) and they don't even open the door for you and apologize, they just sit around and stare at you.	0
Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \"famous\" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code.	0
This Qdoba is walking distance from where I live and I have avoided this place for a very long time because I love Chipotle and I had a feeling that Qdoba sucked. Qdoba does suck. Everything here is bland the rice, beans, and cheese are bland and the guacamole tasted like lemon paste. I will never eat here again.	0
The sad reviews about Pinks at the Red Rock Casino are correct.  We went to Pinks on Friday night before the posted 9:00pm closing and told they are closed.  We finally tried again the next day for lunch and was disappointed with a weak display of a chili dog I could get anywhere.  NOT like the Pinks in Los Angeles.	0
Terrible service. Took FOREVER for the wait staff to get to us, and then they never came back. I couldn't even find a server. Had to go get the manager who was ALSO hard to find. The food wasn't anything to write home about., and normally, I don't care. I go for the bargain, but I'd just rather get food anywhere else. Palace Station has a comparable food for the same price, and their service is much better. Never coming here again. i think the only reason people still go is because they get comped.	0
This place has the best Gyros and Pizza Puffs I've ever had.  Their menu is a little pricey and I have to say that I wasn't thrilled seeing the 1 refill note on the soda machine.\n\nNote to: JT Gyros if you read this I would suggest removing the sign from the machine and allow your customers free refills as you will lose customers with this since other places allow free refills.	2
Had dim sum sampler for 2, seaweed salad, BBQ pork noodle soup.\nIt was just a sponteneous lunch at Mandaley. \nPrice was not cheap either (we paid about $60).  Will go Chinatown next time.	2
Service was slow people here seemed very confused on what was going on they have boxes laying around the store it's 3 stars at best	2
Fairly authentic Chinese noodle shop inside the Venetian. Very casual and not terribly crowded when we showed up for lunch on a Friday. Seated quickly and ordered and the food was out before we knew it. Based on what I observed, food can be a bit hit or miss depending on what you like and order. For instance the Shanghai noodles I ordered had a piddly amount of shredded pork in it but plenty of noodles. Meanwhile others at my table had ordered a bbq plate, kung pao chicken and shrimp noodles and all had quite a bit more meat in it. Service was pretty good and did I mention quick?	2
Stopped in for a quick bite/lunch. I tried the cheese curds and pretzels. At first I thought the cheese curds were okay, then I had cheese curds at Madison's. Sprecher's definitely need some help. Tasted just like a frozen appetizer. I had never had cheese curds before, so I thought it was just cheese curds in general. Pretzel sticks were pretty standard for pretzel sticks anywhere. Highlight of my meal was my beer! I had the Heffe Weiss, and it was seriously awesome. Loved it. I sat outside on the patio, on a beautiful day. That part was nice!	2
3  stars. My customer wanted to come here BC it's convenient and not busy. We were seated asap just after the lunch hour began.\n\nI just ate BBQ at their NLV location so I opted for the Cajun chicken sandwich with onion strings. The sandwich was just ok and the strings were soggy and greasy. I would definitely not order these again! The food was sub par but friendly waitress Annette really made up the slack.\n\nI'd stick to the BBQ and avoid those nasty onion strings, If not for the friendly service I would have given only 2 stars at best.	2
I work in the 400 S Tryon Building. The food is good, nothing to get too excited about, pretty typical. Its great on a rainy day and I dont want to go outside. If you are looking for something fast just walk across the street to salsaritas. I usually wait a good 15 mins for my check.\nThey do have great Bleu Cheese dressing and the wraps and burgers are good. Its a good change from all the chain resturants in the area. \nThe food is also pricey for the area, not as bad as it gets but not too cheap.\nAnother thing I don't like is walking through the smoking area to get to a non-smoking table.	2
Vegas really doesn't have a good mall. This one is certainly easy to get to and has some staple stores (Dillards, Macys, Victoria's Secret, Etc) but is still not amazing. Its still easier then going to the Strip to got to Planet Hollywood, Fashion Show or Forum Shops... so points for that. Someone needs to spend some money and really pump up this mall because it has the potential to be more then just good.	2
The inside of the cafe is neat, very artistic..and according to our hotel shuttle driver, the owner is the artist. It's look like they have some good baked items but we didn't have any..we both ordered iced lattes...we weren't impressed...wasn't very good but doable.	2
I went to Bruegger's on my lunch break to try something new. \n\nI got a Herby Turkey on an everything bagel.  \n\nThey let you get the bagels \"skinny\" style, where they cut out the middle of the bagel so it isn't so thick.  It wasn't bad necessarily, but for $6, I expected more.  \n\nI've been there for coffee in the morning as well and I was not a fan.\n\nOverall pretty decent food, even if it is overpriced.	2
The food is good like you'd expect from In-N-Out.  The staff at this location is incompetent usually forgetting to put napkins or forks with the order.	2
This is my go-to store when i need a bag of chips, a bar of soap, etc.  - it's the closest store to the casa.\n\nI'm a little disappointed Walgreen opted to join the masses and have a \"frequent buyer\" program requiring a card - i've got enough with the various grocery stores ! \n\nThe beer selection stinks but it's rare that i buyer a 6-er anyways so not a big issue.  I like that they have decent sales on sundry items \n\nAlso have to ding them a star for not being open 24 hours.\n\nOverall, a decent walgreens.	2
A perfectly serviceable and cozy option on the Royal Mile. It's inoffensive and the tourists will probably love it, as it's stacked with Scottish feeling. \n\nOne niggle is the seating, which I always feel there isn't enough of. The pub itself has a nice atmosphere, but the long galley style means that seating is stacked up against one side of the room and there's not really all that many spots to pull up a pew. \n\nHowever, it's a friendly little place, and location-wise is well oriented. Nice spot for a catch up with a friend.	2
Free with my room I made the all day buffet my bitch by eating my weight in crab legs... \n\n\nIt's not the Wynn buffett, but seriously, what is?  It also doesn't cost as much.  I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here, but if you get a deal and aren't expecting haute cuisine, it's not terrible.	2
This is for the casino only as we did not, nor have I ever stayed here:\n\nNo poker room (never have had one), cleaner than most of the casino's downtown and well maintained. We played blackjack here and won a bit so that was fun. This seems to be a place that caters to lots and lots of Hawaiian visitors who are big gamblers, so that can be fun to watch as well.\n\nNot sure what the rooms are like upstairs but I do know they don't do reservations on the interweb.	2
The location is good, avenue is a few doors down making it easy to shop for Plus Sizes. \n There are many items and so much to choose from. The clearance section is pretty big. They accept coupons and the clerks are helpful. \n They can be pricey if its not on sale, if you are on a budget I'd hit avenue. If you want quality stay here. I just wish they carried bigger sizes than a 28 and more stretch knits.	2
We finally stopped in for Happy Hour and were impressed.  \n\nWe ordered the Big Ass Burger and the Green Chile Pork stew based on recommendations here and both were excellent.  Portions are huge - we ended up taking half of it home.\n\nExcellent drinks and very friendly professional service.  We also liked the warm and inviting atmosphere in the bar.  Great value too - we were out the door for thirty bucks.	3
