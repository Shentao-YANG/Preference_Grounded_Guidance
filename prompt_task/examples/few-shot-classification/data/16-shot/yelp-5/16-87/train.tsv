Lindo Michoacan is a true authentic. Mexican restaurant. They make home made tortillas and guacamole. \n\nThey do not play with their margaritas.

Not a fan of the flame roasted corn but thats personal preference. \n\nStaff is typical fast food staff. Unfriendly, short fused teenagers but hey what ya gonna do, ya don't go there for the service.	3
My team had a great dinner here one night. The atmosphere and the service were both extremely pleasant. \n\nThe meatballs that we shared as an appetizer were enough for 3 people to get a good taste. My toasted ravioli (a heavy dish, to be sure) was very filling and satisfying.	3
I enjoy Plum, but this doesn't get a higher rating from me because the last couple times I have been, I sat outside and the wait was horrible. Not only to get appetizers and entrees, but water or drink refills too. Both occasions it took 2 hours for 2 people who ordered drinks, apps to share and entrees. Otherwise, I enjoy the food and sushi is good, just wish my food would one quicker.	3
Oh Craftsman, I have begged, begged, begged to come to your restaurant since tasting your foods at my daughter's home in Madison.\nLast Sunday after I flew in from Los Angeles it did not take my kids too many guesses as to where we should eat.\nI shared a mushroom burger and a vegetarian sandwich with my daughter, halfsies.

Been going here for a couple years now. The first discovery was the chicken bowl and beef bowl, for 5.95 the chicken bowl is a 10/10! I get Siracha on the side and a whole fresh jalepeno to really set it on fire. Before ah so, the only sushi I've had was the imitation meat from frys lol, and I hated it. Ah So made me like sushi. I get the spicy crab or golden avacado.	3

Great location and great service! I take my daughter to Karie for haircuts regularly and I have gotten trims by her. She takes the time to listen to what you want and provides feedback on what may or may not work. I highly recommend this particular location.	3

This place is not only inspiration for custom baby photo books, but the ultra sound room is soothing and lovely! Spacious room with large flat screen for viewing. Terry the owner does an amazing job at the sneak peeks. Pictures are instant as well as online uploads, makes for simple sharing with family and friends.	4
I also have been cautious of banfield but since I've been going to the 90th st and shea location, me and my doggies have never been happier. The entire staff is super friendly, Dr Blackman is the most caring and wonderful vet I've ever encountered, she could even handle my old dog Mo when every other vet clinic told me he was a bad dog and to never bring him back. I love them and will always bring my dogs there :)	4
Oh my... this was a great surprise find outside of Las Vegas (near Henderson).  The pizza was amazing, thin crust and crispy, and the freshest toppings... absolutely awesome !   The oven roasted sweet red peppers and Italian sausage... oh my.... I definitely will go back to this place the next time I visit Vegas.  Worth the drive/taxi to try authentic NY style pizza with fresh and tasty ingredients with friendly wait staff.	4
If you're stressing out about a plumbing issue - call Artie! He'll keep you calm and assured by his professionalism and obvious working knowledge & experience. We bought an old house with old pipes and we've had our fair share of issues.But with Artie to rely on, we're always confident with his skills and expertise. He art-fully solves all the issues while managing to keep us from fretting too much. And even though he works all over the valley from Gilbert to Glendale, he's always available when we need him. Artie - you truly are the Master!	4
Best wine bar in town	4
Super useful.\nDespite the fact that the Mirage is right next to the TI, if you are planning on taking a walk down the strip from TI, then every little bit helps because it is a LONG way.\n\nEven from these hotels, it's nice to ride for free and is frequent so there's never really much wait.	4

Clean store, friendly and knowledgable staff, and great selections. Variety of plus size lingerie. Out of the way but would definitely return!	4
This place is a well-kept secret. They have excellent coffees along with pastries and a wide sandwich selection. I have had the California BLT and really enjoyed it. Must be the avocado. I'll post a pic. The owners are very friendly and accommodating to whatever you would like. Visit sometime when you're not in a hurry. It's a quiet place with a homey atmosphere and free Wi-Fi. We always stop by when we are in Fitchburg.	4
The real deal!  Great ribs.  The beef and pork fall off the bone.  The sauce is added to the ribs just before serving.  You have to look in order to find this joint which is hidden away in an industrial area.  You need to go there!	4
Craig's Custom Upholstery re-upholstered my truck bench seat. They matched the original pattern however upgraded the fabric to leather. They also recovered the sun visors for me. Great workmanship, decent price, and they finished before I expected them to. I will go back!	4
Looking for a decent mechanic in the area, I found Parrott Discount Auto Repair on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  So glad that I did.  Straight forward, honest and up front ... everything you need in a good mechanic.  Pricing was decent and also very straight forward.  No hidden surprises or call with a million other things that supposedly  have to be done.  Loved that.  Did the job, did it well and for a great price.  I will definitely recommend them!	4
I had mixed feelings being at SRAH. I was stressed because my cat is not doing well, but I was also very happy to see all the cute cats there. The staff and Dr. Gullinson are the best. The doctor called me at home and took her time explaining everything that was wrong with my cat. I hate hospitals and so does my kit, but we like and trust the staff at SRAH.	4
During the holidays I purchased pies from JBs.  First of all the Manager was very helpful and personable.  Secondly the pies were out of this world.  I am not a pumpkin pie eater, but their pumpkin pie was delicious.  Their apple pie was like I have never tasted and I have tasted a few including homemade.  You've gotta' try the apple pie it will spoil you to any other pie,	4
cool yummy good grub, with a nice selection of non-alcoholic beers if i do say so myself.	4
Okay I get it it's a place from tv.... But to be honest this place isn't that amazing. First off the lady who took my order shorted me on not one but two things! And it took her 5x's as long as any other person to pack it. They need someone too double check the orders before they send it out! I mean come on they pretty much stole 10$ from us.	1
Totally overrated and was WAY better when it first opened. Food has consistently gone downhill over the past year, and is in no way worth the outrageous wait times. We never wait. If we can't get right in, we leave. The food is often over salted and the milkshakes too thick. I think if Burgatory had stayed focused on its food and not on becoming a local chain, the quality would not have suffered so much.	1
The reviews for this place were so good I was really excited to place my take out order. I really like vegetables so I ordered all vegetarian items and I have to say it was just, meh.  Oh well, I guess I'm still looking for that one great place for Chinese in the SE Valley.	1
Used to visit a lot. Service last 2 times was poor. Last time it was a Sat and completely understaffed. No greeting when we walked in. Waiter forgot bread/oil till I reminded him after apps. Drinks went empty. Offered the special (ordered it thinking slightly more expensive, was 2.5x more then any other entree) Made us wait for the check. Food always tastes great but the service just ruins the experience. Feels like the place is slipping. Going to stick with GrapeStreet from now on.	1
Service was less than great.  GM Mark not receptive to comments or constructive criticism. To tell you he heard the same thing before but no change made to menu or waitress serving what you ordered correcting the errors in the printed menu is unacceptable.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was amazing. The tortilla soup was just mediocre. The menu item stating it was chicken stuffed with shrimp and spinach only to be served between two dried out cutlets with a sauce and three shrimp and spinach in between these cutlets does not constitute stuffed by any means.  Go now because if things don't change this place won't make it for too long inSummerlin.	1
Not impressed.\n\nExpensive, mediocre food. Slow waitress.\n\nOkay... not INCREDIBLY expensive, but not worth it for average food.	1
This place is super slow.  I'd go elsewhere if i were you.  The food is iffy at times too. They need to his more for the summer.	1
The nail tech was nice but the pedicure was alright. I didn't feel like she was thorough and my heels didn't feel as smooth as when I went to other places, which is the whole purpose of getting a pedicure. I feel as if I could do what she did at my own home. She would also be doing my pedicure and keep constantly looking away, which made me nervous. I moved to this side of town so I decided to give it a try... I most likely will not be coming back.	1
Cornbread was very good. Had the BBQ chicken which was good but small leg and thigh. Wasn't anything special. Sides were the cabbage, red peas, and sweet potato mash. Have to say the cabbage was the best thing. Everything else was bland with no seasoning. I would not go back here	1
Overpriced Asian entrees, ($18+ for a bowl of pho?!) average service, and plain tasting food.  I did like their spicy wonton appetizer, and the Singapore style noodles were decent... but I don't think I would come back here again.  We only came here because my friends were staying at the Palazzo and had a coupon.  There's nothing special about this place.	1
This place is typical what Arcadia dining is about these days. The atmosphere is great with the patio but the food and service is not good at all. At least they are busy and people like to be seen.	1
Not on my list for a quick return. Had been several years since my last one, so most likely will not be revisited unless the crew decides it's a must do. Sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying. Cut them off or fix them.	1
Maybe it's because I came here late at night when things had been sitting out for a while, but the pastries here really weren't that good. I got the cherry cake slice, which had flavor, but was pretty dry. I also got the black sesame bun, which was also pretty dry. Overall, not something worth raving about.	1
Skip this place. Looking around, I would guess they must be just making it.  The service is lacking. They seem understaffed. The chips and salsa were good. The chicken fundido was average.  I guess it's the empty glasses that sit unfilled, and the mediocre margaritas that earn the 2 stars. The soda was flat, and most of the plates in my party are less than half eaten.  I'm sure at some point they had a good reputation but the current service and level of food is below average.	1
This place was alright, my nephew wasn't too fond of of him barbecue chicken wings. I asked the owner for something different, he made a big deal about it. so we got stuck with unwanted bbq wings.	1
I don't know what happened to this place; all their treadmills are barely operational and the creeper factor seems to have risen -- I go to another location now.	1
Worse experience ever! I walked in for just a trim on the sides wanting to keep a manly side part cut and walked out with half my hair gone. The stylist said he was the owner, will not be coming back.	0
I was referred to this company by my wedding venue which only allows a handful of caters to work at their establishment. The first tasting went very well, when I emailed asking for specific items and made a second appointment that is when I was called an \"over zealous bride.\" That the tasting was just to give confidence in his skills and that he would not be doing 15 tastings for one bride and that there are 10,000 other caters in AZ and to pick one of them. The lack of professionalism was honestly astounding. It has been the worst experience of planning my wedding and took me completely off guard as the flip from nice to disgustingly rude was instantaneous.	0
Horrible. Do not go. The staff doesnt pay attention to your orders or care at all. All the food is watery & lacking real flavor. Even the salsa is pretty crappy. I'd rather eat my own fingernails!	0
Ordered delivery. We got food poisoning from the mussels. Called and spoke with manager who responded by saying they had served a few orders already and thanks...click.  Well played.....a@@@hole	0
I stayed here on a work trip. The clock in my room is stuck on Chicago time, my tub is leaking and there is no wifi (how is that even possible!!?). Also, they add $20 to your room bill every day for coffee and water. I wouldn't stay here again.	0
Go elsewhere.  They quoted one price then charged another. Added parts before asking!   Never called to let me know my bike was finished!   I had to call 5 times to get anyone to answer.  Maybe u have to have 5 tats and 3 piercings to get good service here!	0
Horrible greasy food.\nGm didn't care at all when we complained.\nManagement reflects overall very poor experience. My tummy still hurts!	0
Terrible. This place will suck years off of your life waiting for overcooked eggs, or wraps with wilted frozen lettuce.  Sloooooow! So much for a quick bite for lunch on the way back to Phoenix...	0
Few years ago during the \"starving college student\" stage--I booked a room at circus circus to save a lil dough.  Well the rooms at the towers are ok but they gave us the ones near the back by the RV parking...OMG---maybe it was just my room but I swear my bf (now husband) was itchy ALL night...we swore there were bed bugs...it ended up to be such a bad weekend cuz both of us couldnt sleep well and had bug bites all over...gross..	0
This place is horrible.  I will never ever ever come back.  Room is like a motel 6: cramp crowded and no AC.  No hot water.  Staff is unhelpful.  The only manager available is a gaming table manager.  Also the room is so smokey it was like smoking a pack a night. Our eyes were burning.	0
No meat sauce? Instead I got a tomato vegi sauce. What is meat sauce without meat? Cook with meat tomato sauce instead? \nFrozen vegi with tasteless sausage as meat sauce? REALLY? I can get better steam vegi from steam pack from walmart than this place.\n\nWTF!? I will never return this place ever again.	0
I had the unfortunate experience of having my credit card number lifted by one of the workers......female.....I only used that card once and in three days I received a fraud alert from my bank. After some investigation work and finding out when the charge was made and where,  iI was able to get a copy of the survalence camera and found the individual who made a poor copy of my card.\nI use to love tHis place......never more.	0
Service was SOOOO slow. The food was overpriced and less than desirable. The decor was straight out of Three's Company at the Regal Beagle. We would have fared better by bringing McDonald's in to eat and enjoy the view. Oh, and the AC was cranking out subzero temps. I wished I had brought my parka with me.	0
This place was awful. My boyfriend ordered a burger that was the saltiest thing either of us had ever tasted, and extremely unseasoned. I ordered a chicken wrap that had more cucumber slices and other random ingredients rather than actual chicken. \nWhen I asked about the ingredients of the wrap, the staff told me that it was simply pre made and they really had no idea what it consisted of. \nNeedless to say I was disappointed and will not return.	0
Worst fckn experience ever! We went here last week after watching hunger games and this rude ass host (young girl w/ glasses) just literally looked at us for a few seconds and looked away after we asked to seat a group of 6 people...like are you fckn kidding me?! We asked again and mind you, we asked politely. She never acknowledge us after that...she looked miserable w/ her job. I've never been so fckn pissed in my life that this stupid, rude Bitch had to ruin Fridays. My friends and I were so appalled that we decided to go somewhere else.	0
Ordered Cashew Chickew and the chicken was horrible.  Tasted old, chewy, and dry.  Lots of similar reviews and I have to agree.	0
We usually enjoy the food but hard to get into the price structure. They often have coupons to lessen the blow. First time we went packed lately was dead in there.	2
06/03/12 to 06/05/12\nThe real thing i love this hotel but every time we go we have to pay extra for every little thing this time for view for the strip we have to pay extra the nice room extra because they did no renew the other side of the other tower like a guess from the hotel they not give nothing free \nand I'm agree they need to improve the shows and the amenities	2
We stopped before leaving the museum for a salad and the warm brie, the food was delicious, however the service was slow as molasses, we were left sitting for long amounts of time before placing our drink order, placing our food order and then while waiting for the food, which was not elaborate.  I've sat at the bar before and just had drinks and that usually goes great so I didn't expect such long waits in the nearly empty dining room.	2
Their veggie pesto plate was good... but it wasn't special. I also had the black bean hummus which was a mistake. My brothers both had burgers, again, nothing to come back to, but nothing absolutely terrible. Their service is SUPER slow, and it's pretty pricey. On the plus side, it's pretty healthy, so if your desperate for a healthy meal but not necessarily a memorable one, come here.	2
Food is very tasty. I had the green lemon plate and it taste amazing. The service however it's poor and the cashier is an ass. It was my first time eating here and she make it quite hard. I didn't tip her!!	2
It was good, but not as good as it is expensive. The atmosphere is fine, nothing to get excited about.\n\nThe calamari appetizer is really disappointing.The pasta and bison are great. The service is friendly and somewhat attentive, but not as polished as it should be for the  amount of money you are spending. Servers are dressed as if they are working at an inexpensive chain restaurant. Not chic or professional, which really brings the  vibe down.\n\nOverall, I would say the food is very good, but the experience is way overpriced.	2
This bar is a beautiful mess. Absolutely hilarious and a must-hit spot on any bar crawl. I would recommend making this your last stop - it's always better at that point when you have no idea what you're doing anymore.	2
Went in for lunch on a weekday. Had the spicy salmon and Sunrise rolls. Rice was pretty stale--being that it was lunchtime, I'm assuming this was last night's rice :-/\n\nThe taste and the freshness of both were good. I was the only one in here so service was not surprisingly good and fast.\n\nWould've given 4 stars if they had fresh rice.	2
What's the big deal? It's just thin-crust pizza. The pizza is pre-made if you order by the slice. It's $3 for cheese and a little more for toppings. In Vegas pricing its a great deal but then they get you on the soda - also $3. There is nothing original and the sauce comes from a can. If I'm in the area, and I'm looking for a quick bite, I might come back. But I am not trekking all the way over here from the Venetian again.	2
Only reviewing this with regards to it's Christmas party nights.\nDecent terrine but could have done with some biscuits, turkey was cold and sprouts hard so hardly touched the main course, cheese board was fine but the bread and butter pudding was excellent.\n\n\n \u00a327 for what I take it is the house rose was extortionate though and the DJ was pretty rubbish on the whole (playing an Abba mega-mix twice doesn't really make for a great night). No idea how much a pint was as expected it to be over-priced so took my own supply.	2
Pretty Empty place, but had a good deal on chairs for tailgate season.	2
Ummm, I got sauce on half of my dinner.  I ordered Sesame Chicken which was probably the worst sesame chicken I have ever had.  It's hard to make it bad but this sure wasn't good.  And I got a box 3/4 full of white rice.  I am not impressed with what I got for the price, by any means.  Won't eat here again but my belly is full tonight.	2
I know I will be chastized for this but I dont get what the big deal is. It is very cute and quaint and if you want to impress your date it would probably work. I love the little table outside between the restaurant and bar, thats adorable.	2
Service people seem nice, but I requested a sticker on the window after my oil change as a reminder.  They forgot.  I requested the tire pressure be increased.  They forgot.  Where has good service gone?	2
I *really* like staying off the strip.  No reason to pay $300-400 a night for a bed when the rest of Las Vegas is begging you to visit it.  Things do appear to be changing though. You can't walk into just any pool anymore, so I may have to re-think this strategy.\n\nIn any event, the Westin is nothing fantastic by Vegas standards, but is a step up from a no frills Motel 6.	2
Good post bar food.	2
Deserts are fantastic and you should really come here for the deserts, literally any of them are delicious. The food itself isn't that amazing so eating there isn't really worth the price. Go for the deserts!	3
