Something was wrong with the produce - burgers made me and my kid sick. Awesome milkshakes though. Fries were average. Good atmosphere and friendly service. Wish we ate somewhere else.	1
Looking at all the other reviews about this place, I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry, overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return.	1
I have bought a couple bikes here but that is mostly because Champaign Cycle was too far away and BIkeworks is never open when he says he will be, super run down and condescending. I went in to Durst to look at their used bikes. I wanted a women's cruiser. The only one they had was a huffy Panama Jack for $129 (used!). I checked online and it retails new for $149! I've also had trouble getting help when I go there, perhaps because I'm not wearing spandex even though I ride my bike more than 95% of the general population.	1
I don't know why people would go to buffets when there are so many unique restaurants out here in Vegas. Anyway, my party decided they wanted a buffet and majority ruled. The food was OK. The selection was poor in comparison to other buffets and the quality was substandard. I got jipped! $20 for OK food? On the bright side, they do have this awesome Koi pond that makes mine look like a cheap fish tank.	1
This place is just ok...with all of the choices in Vegas, this is definitely not at the top of the list.  The atmosphere is ok, the service was extremely slow and the food is nothing special especially for the price!	1
The ambience and servers are awesome but other than the avocado roll I wouldn't recommend going for actual sushi. I love sushi and wasn't expecting an amazing sushi experience from a chain but it really disappointed us. \n\nThe miso soup was very salty and fishy. The chile yellowtail dish was just -not okay-, tuna roll-okay, yellow tail nagiri-okay, and the vegetarian roll was really really  rough on the tongue from the green rice paper. We didn't order anything more. \n\nIt also takes a really really long time to get any sushi rolls. The miso soup and edamame come out quickly but that's all.	1
Friendly staff.  Asked for rare burger came out medium well was hard and dry. Bun was a bit stale which did not help. Side Caesar was ok slightly bland. Onion rings greasy needed a different dipping sauce rather than catsup. Waiter did offer to have burger replaced but never been a fan of sending food back to the kitchen.  Based upon the menu descriptions and prices expected better.  Just very average.  Good ice cream for desert, but at $3.95 a scoop it better be!!!	1
I know a handful of people who LOVE this place.  I am not one of them.  Their pho broth is too sweet, their lunch specials are extremely low quality (avoid the orange chicken and lemongrass chicken at ALL COSTS!), and every time I've been here, I left hungry and disappointed.  I give them 2 stars for their strong ice coffee..... but that's about it.	1
My husband went to the riders course at this location and was so disappointed and disgusted by how he was treated he didn't even go back for the last day of class. They overbooked the course with too many people and brought in an instructor from another location to assist. The other instructor was rude, repeatedly yelled at students, and contradicted what the resident instructor lady told them to do.  We spent $600 on the class and required gear.  The class was supposed to be a great time for my husband and a way to get more comfortable on a bike but turned into a total downer.	1
Warhol was still able to elicit $30 from me, 24 years after his death.  But his museum barely elicited 20 minutes of my time or any reaction whatsoever.   Possibly relevant before the onset of computers and specifically Photoshop, his work is now religated the scrap heap of pre-cursor also rans.  Interestingly enough the piece we found most intriguing was Keith Haring's elephant.   While the Warhol museum is certainly a must see destination for tourists, anyone looking for inspiring art might be better served elsewhere.  Oh yeah, kudos to Ritchie Hawtin's doppelganger at the front desk...you guys killed it in Miami that one time.	1
Off strip casino, supposedly 'where the locals go' but the machines were tight so I think that's just an urban legend. Dirty and very very smoky. Sketchy clientele.	1
The restaurant is nice and clean; employees were friendly and I really liked the zucchini sticks...  \nBut the prices are very high for fairly small portions of fast food I feel I could make better at home.  If I'm craving zucchini I might go back, but otherwise I think there are better sandwich/burger-type places nearby... for a much better value.  A solid 2 stars.	1
I was not please with this little donut shop they are pretty pricey. I got 5 donuts and half\nOf my donuts were not cook all the way they all had a very weird taste to them.	1
I've had the tiramisu here before and it was fab.  But the last time I went, it was disgusting.  The texture was gloppy and gelatinous.  It reminded me of very nasty bodily excretions.\n\nFreakin' yuck.	1
Not impressed the food was over seasoned and even the patio was loud.Should cactus salad have cactus? Mine didn't.\n\nI have to lean towards Bill M's response. I think the name and location makes this a so called \"hip\"place to go. I just prefer to taste my food not have it covered up with \"a hint of lime\"which must have been a whole lime. Not real anxious to go back but who knows.	1
Located inside Planet Hollywood, this is a pretty cool place to grab a drink. I came here to pregame every day of the week during my business trip. Mondays are Ladies' Night. My coworker got $1 drinks but mine were $9. fail. Wednesdays are $8 all you can drink wrist bands before midnight, only $5 for girls. They have a cool outdoor patio which overlooks the Strip and CityCenter's new Cosmopolitan. I'd go just to enjoy the view! The crowd is alright here, hit and miss. I did meet some cool, young nurses, and some wonderful ladies on business trips. Cool place. Go and tip my girl  Kaylee!	2
Another great hip hop music club in the Bellagio.  Very small but if you have a table its cool and more spacious.  The dance floor is alway packed.  They always have cool special guest.  The host and service staff are awesome here.	2
Food was jsut ok.  Tried the Kelly's original four cut burger and wasn't impressed.  Had a better burger at Zin Burger.  But the atmosphere is very nice.  The Moscow mule was great.  I think this is the place that charges you if you take the copper cup the Moscow mule is served in.  It didn't matter to me as I don't see why people would steel that copper cup.  My friend had the fish and chips, it was good, nothing spectacular.  Love the patio.	2
Dear reviewers reading,\nCame here last night. And it was dead I thought so for a Sunday but it was my first time coming here and I liked the food and service we had an awesome server but it wasn't really much. That is why I have a 3 star it wasn't really anything there that was good other than food.	2
This show wasn't super extravagant but Lance Burton is one of the classic icons in the magian world.  He's funny and entertaining.  This is just one of those shows that you should do once on one of your vegas visits.  When i watched the show there were a lot of kids in the audience and a couple of loud drunks so be aware of your surroundings :o)	2
Not bad ... Beautiful building, but confusing floor plan. Young crowd abounds. Beautiful silhouette on the exterior drive-up at night.	2
Quick and friendly service, little to no wait time. Try the El Ni\u00f1o margarita, delicious!	2
Went here to grab a lil sushi and was a lil disappointed. The place is amazing inside. Very hip and chic. The ingredients were very fresh, but the presentation was what I would expect from my neighborhood sushi joint and flavors did not excite like I would have expected. That being said, we did not really explore the menu and would give them another shot.	2
Pretty good pizza, we had the bq chix pizza. Not too pricey, but the pizzas are kind of small.	2
Going into this you have to understand you are getting a CHEAP flight... and with that i suggest you do a little research and this will make it all worth while.  Figure out how to pack your luggage into a small carry on.  Pre print your ticket (dont pay for a seat choice just let the cards fall where they may) bring your own snacks and water from airport and you are good to go.  I signed up and recieved like 17000 free miles which translates into 5 one way tickets.. \nAgain know that you are ordering a ham sandwich here folks... and you will be happy with the ham sandwich.. dont expect the steak ;)	2
Carwash is really good but the cafe? Ive been coming to this place for a year now but and they don't have anything in it! I just asked the lady \"can i get coffee?\" All she said was \"i haven't brewed anything for today\" so i looked at her and gave her the \"WTF\" Face! Do your job woman!! Its not hard to brew coffee for someone who's willing to pay.	2
We walked from treasure island to nyny for a hot dog. The woman who took our order was so sweet. She gave us a free drink and chips. I got a plain hot dog with onions and ketchup an my boyfriend got a hot dog with cheese bacon and onions. Good, cheap, simple place. Not a lot of seating though.	2
Wasn't the nicest place I've stayed, but far from the worst.  Hated the restaurants.  Very overpriced, and staff didn't seem happy to be employed. The worst valet service in Vegas. Waited 25 minutes to leave my car, and another 40 to get it back	2
Slightly above avg for food quality.  They serve raw oysters which is what we were looking for. Overall Presentation is nice but it's no Wicked Spoon which is way better in this regard.  Service was slow even though it wasn't that crowded since we got there near close.  Not the Buffet's fault but Beware of rude fellow customers who can't wait their turns in line /to get food and instead grab the neighboring tongs and crowd you out.  Not cool people.	2
They have the best chocolate chip cookies. You can also buy a giant chocolate chip cookie here for special occasions. I have friends who don't like birthday cake so I get them a giant cookie from here instead. \n\nThe have decent salads, great muffins and quiche and their Paradise Club is served on a croissant and is quite yummy. It can be pricey for a sandwich, but luckily my office caters lunch for us from here quite often so I get to enjoy it for free.	2
The Hawaiian Marketplace is made to resemble International Marketplace in Waikiki, except, they don't really sell the same stuff as they do in Waikiki. Little kiosks are set up to sell various items and there are girls dressed in hula wear enticing passers by to come in and watch the Polynesian show they have at certain times of the day.\n\nThe girls are accomodating and will take photos with visitors. There are restaurants and souvenir stores in and around the area also.	2
Very poor show. You would expect arial acts, wonderful correography, and a better Cirque spectacular. The acts were poor, the costumes were outdated and just because some people showed their tits does not make it. We have seen most all of the Cirque shows as well as La Reve. Zumanity does not even belong in the same category. Don't waste your money? Did the dinner package a Gallaghers and that was a total rip off.$60.00 per person without drinks. It did include gratuity.	0
What a waste of my last day of vacation. The lady doing my pedicure didn't cut my cuticles and when I asked her to, she did it dry so my skin was rough. Then when I asked her to make sure that the bottom was smooth, she said she did enough. She calls someone else over who says that they don't take off too much skin or my feet will bleed...my feet get done regularly, by the way. Yes, my feet will probably bleed from the brutal cuticle cutting I received. Guess I'll be getting another pedicure when I get home. Can't believe this place actually has good reviews.	0
I contested the charge with my bank and so far... was able to get this removed. I never got a call back from the corporate office. And when I called the actual location again they told me that I would need to bring in my personal bank statement to prove they charged me again. Very shoddy customer service. It really is a shame because I like the subs and the service they provide. But unfortunately, I will never be visiting a Silvermine subs again.	0
3 stars for the food and -2 for the service. They have pathetic service and a shameless staff.	0
Horrendous! I can honestly say that NOTHING we ordered was tasty...rib eye was alright. But for the price, this place is a huge ripoff. $75 veal chop should be as tender as BUTTER...the veal was tough, and had a weird aftertaste. Pastas...all blah...salads...meh (think maria's italian kitchen) it was so bad that no one in our party of 10+ wanted to order dessert!  With the plethora of nice, expensive steakhouses, spend your money elsewhere in Vegas. SW steakhouse at the Wynn is very good!	0
Disorganized and inefficient.  Waited 20 minutes for a sandwich, name called, confirmed my order, and I drive 10 miles home.  Wrong sandwich.  Call them up, and told I can come back and pick up the right one!  I guess that if you spend your money at this location, be sure to unwrap and physically inspect the sandwich before leaving property.	0
They put the grr in gross.. I would give 0 stars if possible. Enter at your own risk!	0
I had read a review that King's was an over priced Red Lobster. Unfortunately the food didn't even measure up to that. Over cooked fishy tasting salmon that wasn't fresh, soft shell crab was horrible, and for the price point we were expecting much more.	0
CVS' Minute Clinic should be renamed. I have found it to be significantly less convenient than making an appointment with my doctor. Due to my employer's requirement to get a wellness screening for insurance purposes, I have found myself signing in to the minute clinic on 5 separate occasions. Each sign in requires enough info that it takes 5 minutes just to sign in. Only then are you informed how long the wait will be.  I have tried 2 different CVSs at varying times throughout the day (from 8 am to 4 pm) and the wait has never been less than 2 hrs. \n\nIf you have the option to go elsewhere, save yourself the headache of eternal wait times and do so.	0
They scratched my car. A big one and my bad that I didn't notice it while picking up the car. What more I have to say?	0
Since KoMex was closed until 27 Dec for the holidays, my buddy and I went went to Macayo for a real sit-down Mexican restaurant (instead of a fast food Mexican joint).  Big mistake as the kitchen took forever to prepare our food on account of the large group that was in the back room.  \n\nThe chips & salsa was ok, my taco, tamale, enchilada combo was ok.  Our server Melanie was nice, but I don't plan on going back to Macayo.  I'll wait until KoMex is open again or just opt for a fast food Mexican joint.	0
Horrible place! The lady cut me, my sister and mine were bubbly. Crap work. Do not waist your money here!!!! I would give zero stars if I could!	0
Avoid this McDonald at all cost they have the worse staff and the food is disgusting sloppy and will make you sick. I hate this place it's too bad I like mcdonalds food	0
this place is a disaster. sat at the bar a few nights ago and was not impressed. the bartenders are terrible, no personality and down right rude. they even charged me for someone else's drinks then argued with me when i complained about my bill. this place wont last long especially with all the competition in Town Square.	0
Bad service and waitresses unable to do math.  Manager and owner unresponsive to all emails and complaints	0
Lack of Atmosphere (Even during sporting events)\n\nFood is terrible.\n\nBartender/Waitress were incredibly rude....\n\nEverybody has bad days, they should not be this bad.....	0
I disagree with the person who said that they employees here are incompetent kids. True, the person behind the counter is usually half my age but I have been in this place many times and found that even though they are young they are usually friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. \n\nThis is my favorite spot for ice cream in the area. I love Cold Stone and like it much better than all the frozen yogurt places with stupid names that have been popping up everywhere. Plus, even though they are a chain the headquarters are in Scottsdale so hopefully more of our dollars are staying in the state.	3
My family of six ate at Network's after traveling. The waitress was very friendly and patient. We shared meals and she split them up for us without asking. Food was alright. The sweet potato friends were amazing. It was a little pricey, which is why we split, but that's not any different than any other hotel grills.	3
Had it twice. Both times good.	3
Good place to go after your shopping in princess street.Has a good selection of food on the menu to chose from.Its not to pricey either.The staff were polite.	3
My daughter and I went to this new location for a late breakfast. We both ordered the bacon & eggs with pancakes, mine were the halzenuts /Nutella and hers the red velvet one. I have to say, it was great. It hit the spot.  Couple things that bothered me was we did wait a while before the food arrives, and there was a slight smell in the room. The staff was really nice.	3
great ayce. orders come out really fast. the sushi can take some time though. one time we were done eating before the sushi came out. but their food is really good.	3
Stopped by here by accident to grab lunch.  Very nice atmosphere.  Casual but with very cool decorations.  Love the Edison lights wired into the bar!  We both ordered the BLT.  Beautiful presentation, huge pieces of smokey bacon, yummy deviled-egg mayo, tomato didn't have too much flavor but they rarely do this time of year.  Only negative was that it wasn't terribly busy and it took a bit of time to get our food.  Not a real big problem. I would love to come back for dinner sometime.  Menu looked good.	3
I loved this place! Very close to MGM. The hotel is a time share resort, family oriented, clean, small pool and jacuzzi. Our room was a suite- kitchen with dishes, dining table for four, living room, balcony, the bedroom was very nice and comfortable, the bathroom had a great tub. We had a view of the pool. We stayed for two nights.	3
The food was wonderful will take all my friends and family there. The beef brisket is so tender it just melts in your mouth and don't get me started on the hush puppies...wow	3
Had their godiva chocolate cheesecake. Delicious. Great service as well.	3
Sliders & drinks, a regular here (well at least up until I moved back to LA)  :)  Crowd is young & energetic, GREAT sports bar during NFL and Bball season.  GO SUNS!!!  There are small alcoves good for private gatherings which can accommodate varying sizes of groups.  Just call ahead they'll make it happen.	3
Food was excellent. Service was a bit sketchy, but they were super busy. I would certainly go back. The aji de pollo was amazing as was the ceviche.	3
Incredible and I didn't have to go to NYC for the beautiful beautiful presentation for omakase! Far easier to get reservations when you also stay at the Hard Rock Hotel.	3
I totally forgot to Yelp these cool cats! I guess because it's not an actual food location, I just forgot.\n\nWhat can I say that hasn't already been said? The Slider Truck is pretty bomb. I've only been able to visit them once, but I'm a fan. I had three sliders and some sweet potato fries. For the sliders, I chose a Pep Pep, a Yaya, and a Captain's order. I don't know which is my favorite because they were all equally good. And of course, the sweet potato fries were off the hook.	3
Tried Lina's first time last night. Got order to go. Was just reopened by original owners who bought it back a couple of weeks ago. Previous owner defaulted. I got wet chicken burrito w/red sauce, really good, had a lot of chicken. Wife got cheese enchilada also very good, plain for my taste though, I like spicy. I agree with Joseph S review, but only gave 4 stars for now as we got order to go haven't tried dine in, definitely will soon.	3
How is it that I have lived here for almost 20 years and this is the first time I have stopped into Byblos? They have been here - neighborhood local - for almost 30 years! The owner stopped by while we were enjoying a delicious dinner of moussaka, hummus, babaganouche, tomato soup, and the lamb special. Every bite was incredibly fresh and delicious. Don't skip out before having dessert - the tiramisu and honey pudding were incredible. Oh, and the Turkish Coffee - great flavoring with the cardamom. Stop in and say hello - they'll love you for it and your tummy will thank you.	3
First time to Montreal, and this was the third eatery visited.  The other two were very good, but breakfast at Olive et Gourmando prompted me to write a review.  My order only consisted of the Housemade Ricotta \"sweet\" and an espresso, but the ambiance, service, presentation and flavour of the simple dish were exactly what I needed on this Wednesday morning.  Our timing was great, as it was not too busy.  That may have helped my experience, however I will definitely be trying this place for lunch very soon.	4
Best Chinese food in Gilbert BY FAR! Thank you j&k for the great and food! Love dine-in and take out! So exited we found this place!	4
The pizza is great! Flavorful sauce, quality cheese, AWESOME crust, and the slices are pretty decently sized. Great place for lunch- quick, clean, and reasonably priced.	4
aloha:\ngreat place great coffee  aaa+++\nnice folks\nvery high speed wi fi and wire	4
Seriously loved this place. (\"Love\", actually, since I'm still here. Great food, gluten free options, very friendly. Hope they can make a go of it. The house salad had a wonderful variety of flavorful, fresh greens. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and the Penne Genovese were great.	4
This place does not seem like much.  Just a small location in a strip mall, but I have found their egg drop soup is some of the best.  And unlike some places that are hit or miss, it is good all the time.\n\nMainly go here during lunch with coworkers for the lunch special and I have not been dissapointed.  \n\nGood eats for under $10 after tip is good for me.	4
I usually do not get this kind of service at any rental car places, but this particular time I was very impressed. Shuttle bus driver took me straight to my vehicle, at the gate I just had to show my driver license and I was off to my destination. Return was just as fast, and shuttle bus was waiting to take me to the Charlotte airport. All personnel were friendly and helpful, will use Hertz again soon.	4
Love, LOve, LOVE this place.  I have followed the Farmhouse from one location to the present.  I have never had a bad meal there.  GREAT place for lunch...BETTER place for breakfast.\nService has always been very good.\nThe restaurant is small, so sometimes have to wait..but is well worth it.	4
Anne marie is the awesomest of the most awesome peeps at Timbers....woot. she is friendly and you can tell she enjoys her job.  Timbers is a place to go if you want to feel like you are going to a place where everyone knows you.  Food is great, its clean, and its a safe place.	4
Great atmospere.....excellent food.......and awesome desserts. I always get the duck confit it is to die for......their french fries are great, they come with 2 different dipping sauces........you can sit indoors, out on the back lush patio or out front on the sidewalk...very French atmoshere......	4
I have always had good experiences here- the burgers, chicken sandwich, fries, and chili are good. The quality seems better than McDonalds.	4
This is a fantastic library and a great spot in Phoenix. One of the few places in Phoenix that actually makes me feel like I'm in a city.  I love the building, the staff and the selection.  There is always something going on whether it be people watching either inside or in the parking lot, classes, book sales, etc.  I'm glad that I live so close to this library as I'm here almost weekly.	4
Custard isn't really like anything I've tried before. It's rich and creamy. I got chocolate the first time I went there, and I was told by pretty much everyone that I made the wrong choice. Come here for the lemon custard. I haven't gotten into all of the other complicated choices, mainly because the lemon custard on a sugar cone is so darn good! And the prices are extremely reasonable. My one complaint, and it's a small one, is that they don't take credit cards. Oh well, guess I'll have to keep cash around for when the mood strikes!	4
BOMB ASS WINGS!!!\n\nTheir menu is small, but everything is good. My favorite things to order are the Thai Style Wings, Ginger Fried Rice and Pad See Ew. I try to come here at least once a month. This is my favorite place to eat downtown.\n\nOn certain nights they have a dj spinning house in the outdoor part of the restaurant. \n\nI love that they take your order using an iPod/iPhone.	4
For the epic win. Great food. Chill server. Awesome music and $3 car bombs! Can't beat it!	4
The best Thai food I've ever tasted. Friendly attentive staff, service is top notch!	4
I've been to the one at Desert Ridge twice now for breakfast.  Both times the waitstaff has messed up the order.  Its a simple order, side of Bacon.  The food is good, it's only eggs and toast, but the waitstaff is is slow, forgetful, can be rude and doesn't know the menu.  Both times the restaurant was not busy, so the wait staff wasn't slammed.  If you go, make sure you stay on top of the waitstaff or you won't get the correct order.	1
