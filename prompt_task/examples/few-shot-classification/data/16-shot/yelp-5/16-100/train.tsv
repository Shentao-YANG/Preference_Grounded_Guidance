The pizza was bad. The problem begins with ordering. The menu gives a few choice of sauce plus a lot of topping. It does not offer any guidance how to create a good pizza. A few signature pizza on the menu would be a welcomes improvement. \n\nThe price adds up quickly with multiple toppings.   I would recommend any fast food joints over this place.	1
$50 for two. So not worth it. Even if i was a obese tourist. Not worth it.	1
My family used to go to Applebee's as a dinner so I've been to many different ones. This was by far the worst one. When me and my guest arrived there was hardly any business. \nWe ordered our food and drink fairly quickly because of the 2 for $25 deal they offered. When our food came out they didn't bring my guests toast. When we asked for it, it began to get busy and then we were completely ignored. Not only did we have to ask several times to get our toast and check, but we received them together after I had already finished my food and my guest was almost finished. I will not return.	1
I've tried Trifecta twice as the first time I was very disappointed.  Portions were small, food was cold, menu hard to figure out even though it had a small selection.  For the price of what you get, it's not that great.	1
We ordered chicken Lettuce wrap for a meal and needed little more lettuce.\nSo I asked to bring more , was told they don't give out free extra lettuce.\nI said ok just bring some we'll pay.\nWe got about 5 tiny lettuce leaves and they charged 2 dollars for that.\nI talked to the owner that charge was too much.\nShe completely ignored me and walk away.......	1
It looks super hip and it should be amazing but the food was just okay. Our appetizer was a huge grease fest, we asked if it was supposed to be that way and they took it off our bill but not really ever answered the question. We never got refills on any drinks. They were not that busy either. Perhaps we didn't fit their normal crowd of people but I was bummed, it looked fun but I will pass next time.	1
My boyfriend had an IPA which he said was great.  I had an amber beer but would rather have had a wine or lighter beer but they didn't gave that as a choice.  The place is a work in progress.   Needs some ambiance for sure. Dim the lights, add some mirrors (because it is so small, the mirrors will open it up a bit) add wine to your menu and chill your glasses.  Offer a lighter beer choice too.  Menu needs improvement.	1
The ambiance is cool, but everything about this place stenches of mediocrity. The service is below average; seriously, we waited 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, really? The food was okay; nothing special. I would be just as happy with In-and-Out. I am not sure this place is worth all the hype.	1
I had a lot of expectations coming and since the pricing was comparable to that in LA.  However, aside from the friendly service and convenient location,  the fish tasted like that out of a convenience store.  Presentation was great and the rolls were good too.  But the nigiri wasn't anything that I wrote home about.	1
Maybe my son and I have different tastes than most of the reviewers or ate here on an off night. Our experience was that the decor, menu, service, and presentation were all great, however the BBQ was tasteless. We ordered the Whole Hog to share. It included two types of ribs and two meats. The meats were all beautifully prepared, fall-off-the-bone tender, looked great, and then very little taste except for the sweet sauce on everything.\n\nMaybe we are BBQ-spoiled living in Texas.	1
I'm just not a fan of this place.\n\nThe airport is too big and too spread out, it's outdated, and no one is very friendly. I've flown into PHX four times in the past year, and I hate it more with every trip. \n\nIt seems like the airport isn't well thought out; they just took advantage of all the space and spread everything out too much. And heaven forbid you have a rental car - enjoy that trip around the sun.	1
Salty, salty, salty.\n\nCould have been so much better. I got the grilled cheese and it was so salty I had to gulp down my lemonade just to eat it. Which is sad because it was cooked perfectly and looked so tasty. \n\nMaybe it was just a one off accident?	1
The food was very overpriced, especially for a tapas bar. The sardines were not very good, and difficult to pick through all the bones. Also, I'd like to see more vegetarian options on the menu.	1
The only good thing about this restaurant was our food.  On the flip side, the place is dirty, our waiter seemed dirty and it was the worst bloody mary I have ever had.  Sorry, I will not return.	1
My Wife insisted we try this place because she's really into hot wings. Gotta' tell you.... very, very mediocre. Extremely average. It was a nice atmosphere- It was the last day of the regular hockey season with some important (playoff implication) games going on. Service was really good too... But, Food was really lacking and it was barely OK. To top that, I can't stand when my food is served in a plastic basket! If I'm paying Nine Bucks for a hamburger, at least give me a frickin' PLATE!!!!! Way overpriced  as well.	1
.59 fountain drinks! Can't go wrong! Weird people at night, but that's any gas station.	2
Food: 3.5\nService 2.5-3.0\n\nPretty good food overall:  tuna ceviche was light and fresh, blue corn and plaintain chips were good when served fresh, (otherwise the stale were inedible), steak tacos with handmade tortillas were pretty good, and the cochinita pibil was tender.  \n\nService was friendly, however, severely inexperienced or lacking communication between the FOH and BOH.  Experienced long waits even for drinks and forgetful orders.\n\nOther notables:  prices are fairly high, great patio, relaxing dining area, and nicely designed bathrooms	2
Went here for mother's day. To me, it was just OK. On the plus side, they have a lot of seafood choices. Fish, sushi, invertebrates, etc. All you can eat. The staff was attentive. The negative: $27.95/each for dinner, so with 5 of us eating, it came to just a little over $150 and some change. For my money and medium appetite, I would rather go to a nice, sit-down restaurant where I can order a decent $25 entree from a menu. Once a year at this place is good enough for me.	2
We went for breakfast. It is all I can review. It was ok, nothing special. The servers were pleasant. I am not sure I would go back. I have had better breakfasts at other places for half the price.	2
Decent is a good word to describe this place. Decent food, decent service, decent atmosphere... \n\nFood was different but not necessarily good different. Simple things like Mac and Cheese they didn't get quit right. A for effort but C for results.	2
Good food, and very good prices for the location. Right on Fremont Street.	2
This is a really neat store. Came in with the family and was craving delicious pastries. I ordered the cheese danish and my wife ordered the chocolate crescent. I had a hazelnut latte and everyone else had water. The service is very good, and the staff always seem to be doing something. The atmosphere feels like a cool place you would find in San Francisco, but we are fortunate enough to have it here!	2
You always know what you're going to get when it comes to good at Denny's. \n\nWhen they're staffed properly, the service is usually prompt and friendly. Looks like I'm in luck, this morning.	2
came here last summer and i was so excited to visit!! this place reminded me of sweet factory in sf (but they closed it down couple years ago). when i got here i was a bit disappointed because they did not have a big selection of sweets. but i did like how they had those candy jars and boxes to put your candies in. it was a bit overpriced but hey! i'm on vacation. it'll be souvenirs and i can reuse it at home anytime i want to. haha.	2
This airport has improved tremendously. I used to loathe it. Now it's become a standard airport.  True, it's still hard to get from terminal to terminal. But if you had been here ten years ago, you would know that it has made major improvements.	2
Its a cool spot to go.. \nNothing outstanding... only been here ONCE since it changed from Midtown Sundries.\n\nI'll go again and may update it (my review) if something \"Review Worthy\" happends.	2
This place is a good quick hit for lunch and by the pool. Got the short rib burger and some cheesy tots made in house with a nice dipping sauce. Pair those with a Coke, and you'll have spent $40 on a burger and tots. \n\nWhile the food was good, I'm only giving this one 3 stars since it was tasty but not wow-me great. There are a lot of other options that are equally tasty that you could probably pull off for a little cheaper. I wouldn't go out of my way to hunt this place down, but if you are staying at the Wynn or Encore, it's a nice choice for a quick stop.	2
This only got three stars because I wasnt impressed by the rooms and location of the hotel. Compared to other hotels in vegas (minus the circus circus because I have no idea who would want to stay at the creepy place) it wasn't great. But it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.	2
Location hurts this place. It's fun to sit outside and watch what North Tryon has to offer the first couple times going here, but it loses its luster. \n\nNo complaints, but nothing stands out here.	2
Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers. \n\nWhat I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (=	2
Took my wife for her birthday and practically drained our savings account to fill up on food. I will say this: though its expensive, it's some of the freshest fish in the valley!	2
Horrible management. Doors were supposed to open at 12:30 - didn't open until 12:50. Snack bar not ready. Manager wasn't smart enough to apologize. Only open seating - seats very uncomfortable.	0
The food here is decent but one of the staff members was rude the entire time. She was would give snappy comments to my friends and I and complain about every little thing we were doing. We moved two table together so our small group could sit together and she made it seem like it was the worst thing to do in a restaurant. Her manner was uncalled for. We weren't be rude or loud or obnoxious. Most of us were actually on the computer doing school work while we ate but because we were the only group in there we were treated very poorly. Won't be going here again next flight in Vegas.	0
Went to studio to take my first class after paying a week ago and the Landlord had a post that they haven't paid rent and locked them out. They are out of business and I am out of money. Yet Yelp has a great offer for you to pay $75 for $100 of worthless classes. Should keep up to date.	0
The service wasn't even lousy - it was non-existent. After sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for someone, anyone--Hello?-- to greet us, we decided the wait staff was just too busy to bother with us. The food looked great, but not so great when other people are eating it and no one is around to take an order. Busy place but you better know someone if you want to eat there.......	0
Super expensive, did not accept debit/credit, and dented and scuffed walls and furniture. Would not recommend. Will not use again.	0
If I could put zero stars on here I would. Here are some reasons:\n\n1. Guys showed up late.\n2. Movers were watching YouTube and moving extremely slow.\n3. Had to help them move because they were just adding time.\n4. Broke furniture.\n5. Promised a 80 dollar refund a month ago still not received.\n\nYou want reliability I suggest a different mover.	0
your emails are either scams or have never worked....get it together or stop sending them out.	0
Waited over 20 minutes after ordering. Had to pester the girl at the pickup counter several times before she looked at my ticket and gave me a stale sandwich that had been sitting out for 10 minutes. No apology for screwing up the order. I was so hungry that I ate most of the sandwich before realizing it wasn't the sandwich I ordered and had mushrooms on it. I recommend avoiding this place if you have food allergies or have less than 45 min to order and eat.	0
Poor service, cardboard cookies, flavorless cakes. A huge disappointment, everything we bought ended up in the trash uneaten.  Bouchon just down the corridor is much, much better.	0
This place won't be open very long if they're not staffed! I just walked in stood there for 10 min & no one was there to help me so I left!	0
Not sure what to think of the place comments are older now. Ran into the girl that owns/runs the place. It had seemed to be closed she was wearing one of their shirts and made some comment off the wall seemingly in reference to not being much longer before they closed their doors. Went in small group of people - quite crowd! Not very friendly place I guess you're somewhat of a regular. Not a place I come to often nor will I!	0
The night crew seemed to be playing and cracking jokes as soon as I walked in. I'm black the joke was definitely on me. Lol. I could care less about the jokes I just hope my food ain't sabotaged. SMH	0
Used to go to this car wash all the time always great service they fix some of the problems with not excepting credit cards and the vacuums  have gotten Better but recently however their new policies don't allow them to prep my entire vehicle at the beginning they don't wash it anymore they just get my hood and windshield wet and then when I'm exiting the tunnel they dry off my windows and don't touch the body they leave most of it wet so I'm going home with spots and my rims just don't come out clean anymore I won't be going back  unless they fix these problems my suggestion find another wash in the valley	0
Came here only to find out that my two favorite bartenders were gone. And since the current bartenders are catty bitchy females who obviously didn't want my money (as shown by their eye rolling) I happily took my money and my tendency to tip 50% elsewhere. The food here sucks, anyway.	0
Tried calling in a order and was on hold for 15 min. Called back 10 times and line was busy. FAIL FAIL FAIL	0
If I could give the new Pei Wei zero stars I would. Decided to give it one last try and it was even worse than before. Tried the Honey Seared Chicken and it was the most dry dish I've ever had. It also had no flavor, which is one thing that kept me going back to the old Pei Wei. We also tried a salad, but it basically only tasted like the little tangerines pieces in it. I guess I should've known this was a bad place when they completely eliminated the kids menu. Oh, and putting everything in to-go dishes just seems so wasteful! I won't return here ever again.	0
Meh, its Walmart. My bf likes going here, he like has wet dreams over this store... I told him just to work here because we go like once a week! Its all the same to me, all I usually go to buy is TP because I like support the non jerks to their employee type of store.\n\nIts nice if you wanna just go to one place and like older produce and not fresh meat!	3
A wide vairety of movies with lots of showtimes, nice plus!! This theater is fairly new so the sound is crisp and the screens are beautiful, all surrounded in a contemporary design. Theater was clean and tidy, the seats were comfy and roomy, and the temperature was just right.\n\nNote: you get what you pay for, $10.75 a ticket mid-week night just FYI.	3
The best part about Bally's is the location.  They're right smack dab in the middle of it all.  The rooms are very comfortable with a lot of room to move around.  The bathrooms are also really nice.  The worst part about Bally's is the casino, which needs a little  upgrade, but I would not let that stop me from staying here.  If you're looking for a middle of the road priced hotel with clean rooms and a GREAT location, Bally's is the place.	3
I only get the Betty Boop & and orange soda and it's so much food that I don't need anything else.  The chicken is really good.  The waffles are even better.  Both taste great with syrup on 'em.\n\nI tried the mac & cheese once...it was just ok.  I tried the green beans...they were good.\n\nI like the atmosphere, location, service and supporting locally-owned business, so I'll be back any time I can!	3
I've been back twice, still unsold on the iPad but the food is good, smoothies are healthy and excellent and their servers are very good. I recommend. A little pricey but I'll go again.	3
The crab soup was awesome, with saffron and just delicious. The lunch of fresh fish was also wonderful. Their seafood was very fresh and they made me a whisky smash to start off, which was also great.	3
Very creative spin on hot dogs and very tasty. I had the duck fat fries and they were delicious - though they did taste a little burnt. \n\nThe Bahn mi dog has the perfect blend of ingredients.	3
We stayed at planet hollywood, and Earl is right downstairs from our room,  If your looking for something gourmet, this isn't it. Very simple and tasty hot panini, not alot of stuff in them mostly meat and a small amount of cheese. We particularly enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, The only reason for the minus 1 star was the service was not friendly-but I didn't expect anything more so ....	3
Love it. Huge servings for a cheap price. Friendly staff, good food, and doesn't take forever to prepare. Will recomend to others!	3
Fabuloso! I had a chicken chimichanga and it was HUGE and so delicious! We also ordered some chips and guac and they FRESHLY FRIED the chips. So, so good! Everything was fresh and the portions were large. This will be our new go-to quickie dinner spot. I just docked one star because I wish they served beer.	3
For a $5.00 matinee ticket, absolutely zero complaints here. The theatre & restrooms were clean, (the gold standard in my book), the theater itself was a comfy temp.,didnt need the hoidie I carried in. I am not one to blow dough on concessions, so can't comment on their prices, but overall a great experience. The seats are roomy, floors non-sticky, & I will def. visit again.	3
This is a family run restaurant that fills the need of home cooked food at a fair price.  There is a comfortable feel with wait staff that calls you Honey. On Fridays they tend to have a all you can eat special, deep fried walleye or fried chicken. Is this the best food I have ever eaten, No, but there is lots of it and it is always good and reasonably priced.  They open at 5am till 10pm, daily.  If I am hungry, this is my goto place.	3
Popped in late on a Sunday night after 18 hours of traveling to Edinburgh.\n\nHave to admire the fact that the bartender took such care to pour a pint of Guinness from the tap. I was mesmerized by the whole process.  Great selection of brews and scotch. \n\nThe service was great. Nice people, tons of TVs to watch virtually any match you're trying to catch. Food was not as memorable as the pint of beer. But then again, I was new in town.  Cheers!	3
I didn't love it,\nBut somehow drank for six hours.\nMust not be that bad.	3
Pretty good place to eat....had the peanut butter burger...interesting...wish it came with some jelly honestly, shake tasting was good just wish it was in bigger quantities.....good place for a quick bite	3
Great Sonoran enchiladas.  Very flavorful, authentic Mexican food.	3
I've been coming here for a while now and have to say im never let down. Food and service have always been impeccable.	4
Niki did an amazing job! I was on a budget and wanted some pictures of my boys. She made it work with what I had. The location at the park was perfect and the pictures turned out great! Some were posed, some were random, but they all showed my sons personalities shining through. Then she not only sent me a few \"tease\" pictures but delivered the disk to my home very quickly. She is very professional and made my boys feel at ease. She will be our photographer for all my future events.	4
How can anyone not love Nandos? Food is seriously addictive, I think its the spices that keep you coming back! Ordering system is quick, & the whole atmosphere is very relaxed. Ok maybe not the best venue for a slap up special dinner but day to day this is great for so many things... the best being a hungover get together after a night out. Nothing cures a hangover like a Nandos! Staff in this one are friendly & look happy. Is in a good location & seems to have shorter waiting times than the one at Fountain park (maybe due to the cinema?).Try the mango & lime sauce mmmm.	4
I love, love, love the food here! They have amazing deals as well that make it so easy to make Salut a prime spot to go to on the reg! My favorite is the siracha panini and the PENNY MIMOSAS!!!!	4
I'm addicted to gravy so i always get the loco moco. Its basically a burger patty & 2eggs of your choice on top of the rice drenched with gravy!! Also have to try the lumpia shanghai. Service is fast eventho everytime we come here there's a line. :-)	4
Love love love love love this place! They don't rush and they do a wonderful job in a reasonable amount of time.	4
LOVED.\n\nHad a HUGE burger here last thursday.\nThe food was pretty good, and they have probably the biggest selection of beers I have ever seen...and entire book full!\nWent late to watch the dueling pianos, Awesome!!!\nthey also had karaoke that night along with the pianos...alcohol and karaoke is always a good time.\n\nWill definitely be a regular here.	4
This place is amazing.  A real bar in an unreal city.  Very chill place, packed on weekends.  The bartenders are great (and tolerant!), the jukebox is original without being weird (totally had some great Phoenix tracks).  Have had enough good times here that we named our dog after the place after getting some great suggestions from the staff (Schnapps, Jose, Jack, etc.).  \n\nAnother good spot around the corner is the Downtown Lounge...\n\nPS:  Shoop shoop to the Griffin for having a clean ladies room.	4
very good, very refreshing, very fresh with a very creative spin on how to make a good sandwich, all in all my new favorite sandwich spot. fukk subway lol...	4
Chris was very upfront and honest with me. He also saved us 50% over a quote we got on the phone from a competitor. Give APCO a try when you get invaded by ants, spiders, scorpions, or lizards.	4
This is my go-to theater :)\n\nSmallest crowds of all the surrounding theaters- unless we're talking midnight premiers for Twilight and the likes. The tweens spare no one!! \n\nWide variety of show times\n \nGood parking- it's plentiful and all around\n\nFriendly staff- there are people here who I've seen grow up!.. yes, I'm old -_- \n\nGood food/shopping options within walking distance for before or after your movie :)	4
love it	4
Unbelievable food and service. Honey wasabi dipping sauce is to die for. Japanese and soul food fusion... who could ask for anything better! Definitely a must when in Vegas.	4
Brunch. Heaven.	4
This is the fourth incarnation of this restaurant site we have visited. This one is head and shoulders above the others. I had the $4.95 week day special 6:30 - 10:30 am. Didn't really expect much for that price, what a surprise! I ordered the sausages, which were very good quality, and the pancakes that were thick but very fluffy. The quality of the food is apparent. The coffee is organic free trade. My partner had an omelet she really enjoyed, and I tasted some of her whole wheat toast and jelly which was wonderful. We will be putting this one in the rotation.	4
Super entertaining!!! \n\nSure there was some music that I could have done without, but overall the show was awesome!!!\n\nOur tickets were about $80 for the 2nd level. There's not really a bad seat in the house at Monte Carlo.\n\nIt appears that there are more dancers than the original Jabba, but doesn't discount the show. Actually it enhanced the show. Our party was definitely getting into the the music and dancing and when Jabba started dancing to a snippet of NKOTB - o, it was soooo on!!! The girls went off!!!\n\nPure entertainment and highly recommend checking them out!!!\n\nSD represent!!!	4
I didn't care for this location too much. The employees weren't rude but not very polite either. The whole time we were ordering they were talking amongst themselves. My food had way too much sauce on it so I had to pour some out on the tray. There were also a couple flies that would not leave us alone and some children that were running around and being loud. After I are I went into the bathroom which smelled disgusting so I decided just to wash my hands and leave. Of course there wasn't any soap. We decided to go to this location because we heard it was quieter but I think I know why now!	1
