This place is decent.  I live within walking distance but have only been once if that tells you anything.  It's just normal pub grub, and none of it is really impressive.  The slay the dragon program is kind of fun, although I haven't made much of a dent in my card because I never go.  Supposedly they have quiz night on Thursdays which might cause me to up my star rating...	2
Wow, way overrated, but not really a bad place either.. I received so much HYPE about how GREAT this place was, and people went into the Diners Dives n Drive thru's, which for me was a selling point to try. Great concept though, a mix of 3 culture to quench most cravings. I got the Chinese BBQ Pork (Great) and the Jerk Chicken (fair) with the beans n rice... Rice was a tad undercooked, and the Jerk chicken lacked the JERK from other Caribbean food I have tried..	2
Trust me to go to a bagel store and get everything but a bagel. After a week of Vegas living, I wanted to get something healthy and got a fruit cup, a vita coconut water and a banana. Damage was $15. The lady at the counter gave me a good natured ribbing about my diet. It did take another week to detox from that trip though.	2
Basically it's Subway.  Service is so so, sometimes it's good but usually it's mediocre at best.  It seems when ever they get a few people they get a little freaked and hurried which seems to make it all go slower.  I'm a veggie sub fan myself and they always skimp on the veggies so I have to ask for extras.  Just assume double if it's a veggie sub people!	2
I had high hopes to try their hot dogs.  I got the beef dog but it was ok, a little too charred for my taste.  The fries were great.  The wait in line was about 20 mins.  The place was packed due to an ASU game.  Some of the tables were dirty.	2
It should be called the dessert buffet.\n\nI loved the chocolate covered strawberries, cotton candy, ice cream, frozen yogurt, fruit tarts, cakes, etc etc.\n\nSweet Tooth be the death of me.  Everything else was standard.  \nPrice $22 per person. \n\nSpecial Shout out to the wait staff, especially the guy from El Salvador!	2
We decided to have Korean, got a great deal from groupon. We ordered the seafood noodle soup it was spicy . It had mussels, octopus,  shrimp and  some vegetables It was good it came with all these side apps. like kimchi.  A bit hot for me \n\nI made sure I had plenty of water to drink.    This soup can be for served for 2 persons.  \n\nIt was not on the menu, luckily the customer next to us had that.  And recommend to us. There was so much more I want to try. We enjoyed everything  !	2
This was the first and only Thai place I've been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we can't find anything better, I think we won't have any problem going back to Swaddee.\n\n*Price = on the high-end \n*Pad Thai = pretty good volume\n*Green Curry = very good.\n*Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11	2
Last time I was there, the dog sitting at the bar really threw me. Before that, the dog that bit my brother (which was my brother's fault per the owner?) made me think of not coming back. Just needed a cigar today, and the girl behind the counter was pleasant, but the \"regulars\"/bar rats seemed to be taking up most of her attention.	2
I stayed at both the older rooms and the newer rooms... The older rooms REALLY sucked... They smelled really bad and was not well maintained. \nThe new rooms On The other hand, the GO Towers was awesome. I loved the mini fridge that they had. I can keep cold water and drinks in there for the kids. They were much cleaner and super comfortable. \nAs for the table games.... There were a few really great dealers but a majority if them seem as I'd they don't want to be there.	2
Had to drop a star for these guys.\n\nHave tried a handful of other \"non deep fried\" dishes and they all just kinda leave us flat.\n\nThe Chow fun is still the best dish they make. We have been moving over to Chous and Chodang lately for Asian	2
The operative word would be \"adequate\". the $3. 99 basic car wash is pretty much as advertised suitable for rinsing off a light layer of dust if not much more. Bird bombs remained intact, but at 5.99 and up however,  you get a pretty decent automated wash, rinse and blow dry, and no extra charge access to the self-service vacuums  at whatever price.  There's better and there's worse but by and large Clean and Fast Car Wash lives up to its name.	2
Definitely did not enjoy this meal as much as I hoped to. I ordered a shrimp with risotto and it was lackluster in flavor and disappointing, especially for the price. For dessert we got a chocolate brownie dish with ice cream. It was also just ok...again, for the price I would have expected better.\n\nMy boyfriend got braised pork and it was also underwhelming. The meat was tough so his teeth ended up hurting from all the chewing. Service was decent but the price was high. Food is not terrible, but I think there are definitely better options in the area.	2
Unlike it's line, I'm going to keep this short.  Tasty but small, expensive and slow.  Maybe worth going back every now-n-then for a date night dessert but no more frequent than that.	2
The food was very good, but would it kill them to put more than 2 tiny tomatoes on an entree plate, given the absence of salad or any other veggies?? Maybe I'm just an un-hipster, but I just don't get this trend in dining. \n\nWine was disappointing and very expensive - $75 for a mediocre bottle:(\n\nForgot to mention that our table had the distinct feeling that the waitstaff thought we were all in kindergarten. They spoke to us in a quasi-baby talk and pointed out each morsel of food on our plate while explaining what it was. Guess that is also considered \"hipster\", but we just called it awkward.	2
I thought Crossroads Farm lessons were good enough until I went to a different stable. The group lessons are not very effective and the tack is not in good shape. One lady actually fell off her horse because the stirrup strap broke.  \nHopefully they have improved since I was there which was about a year ago.	1
I suppose if this is your thing... First impressions, location is quite poor. Best thing in area is Hispanic grocery and goods store across the street. Locale itself is pretty beat. Go here only if you absolutely must. Dark (at night), music is good if Chris is spinning the tunes. But the environment itself is really lackluster. The place lacks what people would consider \"character.\" I have to give it a low rating overall.	1
Like most of the skuzzy strip clubs along Highland Drive, Foxy Girls reflects the kind of place you'd find in a town that's embarrassed to have a business where men pay to watch women take their clothes off [which is odd, because Vegas revels in skin].  It's hidden away in the industrial area, it's small, the dancers are run down and the drinks are overpriced.  \n\nThat said, at least the place serves alcohol.  And when we were there, the dancers were good conversationalists and didn't immediately treat the customers like ATMs (that came later).	1
It's been years since I been inside of a target. And I see why over price small selection of everything.	1
Schlange stehen. Morgens, mittags, abends, nachts. Dank eher langsamer Mitarbeiter gerne auch mal ein wenig l\u00e4nger.	1
I went to this Pita J and sat at the bar.  I liked watching all of the cooks bust their butts to get the food out.  But the waiters...yelling at the cooks and not saying please and thank you!  Putting their fingers and hands in and on top of the food that they are going to serve to customers... The money tip goes to the hard working cooks and not the waiters.  Wont be going to this Pita J again...maybe one of the other Pita J's will have a better attitude towards their cooks.	1
Oh no! Everyone has an off night, but this visit was extra special. Waitress argued with us over the food items and kind of threw down drinks and walked away. Very uncomfortable dining experience. Just not worth a return visit.  I hate being uncomfortable, especially when it's meant to be a nice relaxing evening out.\n\nFollow up: in all fairness we spoke to the manager who was very understanding and supportive and took our concerns seriously.	1
Last minute Bloody Mary craving brought me and a girlfriend to Rao's one Saturday morning.   The line for the buffet was insanely long and Rao's empty tables were just what we needed.  Having eaten an incredible meal at Rao's in 2004 for a wedding reception at Caesar's I had high expectations but unfortunately something was amiss here.. \nOur Bloody Mary's were watery, my pizza boring, and my salad was meh.  I am sure if I had not gone on with incredible memories of a meal that happened nearly a decade ago I might have enjoyed it but this was a big disappointment.	1
This place reminds me of Santana row in that it has a very high price due to locale and stigma, but ultimately has mediocre taste.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients could have been better.\nThe chai we ordered was way too sweet, and as far as taste, you could get that a drive thru for $2.\n\nNice presentation, though.\n\nI had a double espresso that had a really weird taste that was acidic.\n\nThe Dulce De Leche Croissant, Apple Cauchon and the Eclair were  A-OK.	1
They where incredibly excellent for awhile but now they seem to be falling more and more. Even the beer is warm now. Don't know what has happened.	1
My last visit here, one of the guys behind the counter smelled really bad. They put my sandwiches up on the counter but didn't say anything to anybody, AND they left their dust pan and broom propped up on the soda fountains. Maybe the boss was away that day or something.	1
Loved Point Park so I thought I'd check out Point Brugge. \nIt was only moderately worth it.  Maybe there was something that I was missing.\n\nWe went here for lunch and ordered some crab cakes and fries. I easily could have defrosted some crab cakes from Giant Eagle and enjoyed them just as much, spending half as much. \n\nAs for the fries they were way too greasy for me.  I understand they aren't your normal fries but it was a bit excessive.  \n\nDefinitely sticking to Point park.	1
Pay to cook my food? What the? And it is quite the average variety.	1
Always have enjoyed eating at Chili's but this location was not up to par. Ordered pick up for the margarita grilled chicken and when I returned to my office to eat it was surprised to find only 1/2 the regular portion in the box. -3 stars for value in my book. Will not be ordering pick up from here again.	1
As a parent I just can't find much nutrition in this menu plus I've never had a meal here I like.  With that being said.  My sons love this place.  Thick sweet syrup on most of the entrees and meals is probably why. When they beg to here I eat elsewhere and let them indulge	1
We waited in line for about 25 minutes to get seated. Well I felt pretty disappointed overall to say the least. The lamb and pork were edible. Can't say as much for the chicken and beef. Kind of sad when the best things on the buffet were the vegetables and dessert. Even then heck I feel as a decent cook I could have done something much more flavorful. For about eighties buck a couple I could have stayed home and made an outrageous gourmet meal. Really can't really recomend this bloated fare to anyone high or low who enjoys buffets.	1
Great service and great food. We came for breakfast today but had to leave due to an emergency before our food came out, they were more than happy to bag our stuff quickly so we could be in our way. I really love their lemonade, it is hard to find good lemonade sometimes. My wife loves their pecan pancakes. Only downfall, no military discount, and there tends to be more rude and closeted racist at this restaurant than most, I guess it has a lot to do with the name. Maybe I'll have better luck for lunch, I'm going to Mein Kampf Eatery, should work out great!	4
My \"new\" husband and I went to Owen's for brunch the day after our wedding. I absolutely loved my bagel and got a few bites of Joe's that were fantastic as well. I love the location, the staff, the funky decorations, and the music they play in the joint. It is definitely worth giving a try... from this point forward I will drive past the major bagel chain on South Blvd. that I've been known to frequent to support this awesomely delicious local restaurant!	4
Great pizza. Yes, it's busy, but it is a new location and there's a shortage of great pizza places near by. So glad they moved in.	4
I could literally eat here everyday. The only downside is that sushi isn't always available, but the quick service, perfectly cooked rice, mouthwatering sauces, and great selection in different cuisines makes up for it by far. And I prefer places that will wait for their sushi guy to come in at night to make a perfectly balanced and delicious roll!	4
You can sit for hours with your laptop, with a good book, or talking and meeting new friends as you enjoy your coffee or tea and listen to great music.	4
The best in family resturants!  Great diverse menu,  wonderful service, and game room for the kids.  I choose this place for a night out with or without kids.	4
THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!	4
Went in for some late afternoon eats with few expectations for we were unfamiliar  but we were pleasantly surprised.  Enjoyed the everything guacamole, chorizo fries, four assorted tacos and some NV beer.  Christian (owner/chef) was super hospitable and gave us many insights into his 'waste not want not' style of cooking, using whole local goat and pig for his prep. Highly recommend and will return.	4
Great food great hummus..the sauce they give you for the fries is awesome. Gyros are really good! Gyro Portion size kinda small for the price. Free baklava w/ yelp checkin and is really good.you can get a tray for 10 bucks for 12 pieces to go and I recommend!! The whole menu looks good and I would definately go again..staff was very friendly.	4
The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was as nice as can be.	4
Can't believe I am giving 5 stars to a place no one ever wants to go to. The Audi Service Department is like the dentist, you know you need to go, but you worry about what they'll find. Al is by far the best Service Rep I have ever worked with. Always accommodating and no bullshit games. I know this Audi has been more challenging than my past Audi's, but with that said Al and the Audi service team have been straight forward and have taken care of all of my issues with complete ease.	4
Recent experience with LawTruck was great. Trustworthy & reliable. Always kept informed of situation and updates. Highly recommend to others.	4
A delicious breath of fresh air just off the craziness of the strip. Their breakfast is really good, and for a great price. Greek Omelette was huge and filled with lots of feta! Their French toast is thick and cinnamony! Everyone was really friendly and the service was terrific.	4
This is one of the best Irish pub/restaurants the valley has to offer. They also have live bands perform on occasion.\n\nI used to work very close to here and wandered in about once a week. The food is authentic, with fish and chips and dozens of other traditional Irish comfort-food dishes.\n\nThe bar is wonderful with seating for about 20. They offer plenty of expected Irish Beer and Whiskey selections. They have a small patio for us smokers too.\n\nService is friendly, though it can be a little slow when they are really busy (lunch, happy hour and weekends).	4
I cant say enough about how cool this place is...I always call ahead for my lunch break and they always mange to throw in some kinda complimentary chips or tea..just makes you feel so welcomed and appreciated. The owner is very nice (and cute) and he always greets you with a smile. Kudos yall;)	4
I love the private rooms upstairs that make for an intimate and relaxing experience. I've come here with friends several times, and it's always been a great experience with friendly staff, great atmosphere and delicious tea.	4
Home Depot is usually pretty good.   Not this one.  The customer service is usually awful and the cashier lines are rarely ever open.  Unfortunately I have to go to this one for work and I leave frustrated every time.	0
First impression. Rude service. Waitress took order across table. Waitress also did not take responsibility for order. Said she didn't know since someone else took order. Waitress name Geo. Fish was stringy. Only good thing about this place is price...but then again, I guess you get what you pay for...definitely will not return.	0
Lost our reservation and snooty about seating us at 9:15 even though there were many open tables. Disappointing.	0
Lame!!!!!!!  Why waste your time here when there are dozens of better shopping centers less than 3 miles sway?	0
Quoted us 20 mins ETA for our food. Didn't get it till almost 1 hour later. Weak portion, extremely pretentious presentation...had to go next door at the croissant place to get more food. Furthermore it does not take an hour to smear nutella on a crepe and add some sliced bananas on top. Neither should it take any more time to add some weird lemon \"gel\" and butter on a crepe. So disappointed.	0
Awful.  Got there late to our group.   Wouldn't serve us food, even an appetizer!   Our check took an hour, could have easily served us a small plate.  Crazy!!   I eat out at least five days a week, so this was nuts!!!	0
This place closed permanently in Dec 2011. They are replacing it with a bunch of condos. Probably for the best, it had seen better days.	0
Horrible customer service.  In new towers 2 of 3 elevators didn't work.  Old towers run down.  NEEDS WORK	0
Is it possible to give a -5 star rating? If it were, I would give it to this location! \nThis is the worst, worst, worst Panera Bread I have ever been to. \n\nWhy do I continue to go there you may ask... because it is so close to my house, I have limited options as a vegetarian on the go, and apparently I am a glutton for punishment. \n\nI have spoken with three different managers regarding the issues I've had with my meals, and nothing ever seems to change.\n\nI can finally say that I will not be going back, au revoir!	0
This review is purely for the late night dining. We ordered take out here one night and the wait for 2 simple orders was about 30-40 minutes. Then we decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves and ordered the very next night. The wait was AGAIN about 30-40 minutes, but for ONE order. It wasn't even busy. There is no reason food, TAKE OUT FOOD, should take that long to prepare. The food itself was OK, but the reason I will never be back for late night take out ordering will be the wait time. \n\nAbsolutely, inexcusably ridiculous.	0
They were shutdown due to too many health inspection demerits :(\n\nhttp://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Happys-Pizza-265623751.html?lc=Smart	0
This has got to be the dirtiest place I've been. The staff is run horribly. The trash is over flowing behind the counter and the PM special for $5 is horrible. The staff was all wearing dirty shirts. My wife and I will not be coming back.	0
The beers were warm and flat.  The bartender was argumentative when we told him about it.  6 employees working on a Sunday afternoon and I still had to get up and go to the bar to get napkins for my wings since none were brought to me with them.  The place is cold and not inviting at all.  We won't be back.	0
Pizza was soggy and had a very thick crust (this was not a deep dish or Sicilian). Prices were higher then those shown on the online menu.  When  shown the difference the delivery person  without hesitation pointed to the menu he brought showing the disclaimer that  prices can change without notice. This probably happens often.\n\nDon't be a sucker and order from this masquerade of a pizza shop!	0
Creations in Cuisine catered my wedding in September.  We had a burger bar set up. The burgers were under cooked, there were no vegan options as we requested, and they ran out of food for our guest. Simply put, we were not satisfied.	0
Really slow service! Won't be back. Should have trusted the reviews of my fellow Yelpers	0
I love Bomberos! It's a great place to meet with friends...the couches are cozy for conversation inside and there is a great patio out back complete with a a fireplace. I love that they focus on South American beers and wines. The food is great...the service...not so good. On one of my visits I was served wine in a glass with a big crack down the side. Not sure how the bartender or the server didn't notice that. But other than the service, I love this centrally located bar.	3
First thing you will notice is their insane chocolate fountain hidden behind a thick layer of glass. Apparently it is the world's largest chocolate fountain in existence. \n\nIn any case, gelato and crepes are top-notch. Prices are on point given how expensive Vegas has become. Worth a stop if you need a break from the hustle and bustle of the casino floor.	3
Their drinks R always so good and make 'em fine and strong. The food always good mix of flavors and combinations I love how they aren't afraid of trying new flavors and so far they have make my palate happy and the ones of my friends too. So yes I liked and keep going for more!!!	3
Small gelato for $3.99 the size of a baby scoop. A bit pricey but I just call it a casino, non-national-chain premium. I got the pistachio but also sampled the spicy chocolate (a little too spicy), mixed berry (tasted like the costco smoothie), and mint chip (super minty but a bit more spearmint than peppermint). Overall the gelato was flavorful with a smooth, creamy texture.\n\nAlso, the worker helping us was great. He offered as many samples as we needed (for a large group) and was very patient with the orders.	3
I love this place. It is our consistent meat the Caris' joint at least one night a week. Chicken Quesadilla for the kids, burritos, enchiladas and baskets of mini tacos for the big kids. Plus a $3 margarita or three... the first time we went for a business meeting our server was about 150 years old, but bless her sassy heart she was fun and had no patience for us until we sassed her right back, then she was great. Since then, the younger staff has been great, even when we wipe them out of chips!	3
No matter how many times I go, I'll never get used to the ordering system. But the food is delicious (expensive, but it's one of the few places near me with healthy options). I love their Broccoli Cheese soup and the Greek Salad. Plus it's nice to take some time to sit down with a good book or NDS game and relax on my lunch break.	3
Great sushi in a great modern sushi bar.  Happy hour menu is great however the standard menu is expensive.	3
The only place I stay in Vegas. Great prices. I don't need a fancy room since I only use it to sleep 3 hours. \n\nThe pool is nice. I love the slide. I love the drinks. I love Vegas!	3
Went here during the tree climbing festival. It was nice. There's an easy walking trail right around the water.	3
Ate here twice during our stay in Montreal.  Very busy place so I took that as a good sign.  Overall the soup was good but it was a bit confusing with the ordering and what types of meat were in each dish.  What my wife ordered looked very different than the picture on the menu.  I liked it as well as our usual Pho place in Toronto but not as well as our favorites in New York or San Francisco.  I would recommend it, not outstanding but quite good.	3
Cute stuff but pretty pricey. Still, if youre like me, you only shop during sales. I was pleased to get a cute little necklace for my daughter regularly priced $16 for $7 and change. They have a lot of cute girls accessories, crafts, stuffed animals, games, & other goodies. 3.5 stars but I'm rounding it up to 4.	3
I can't think of any other place where you can buy a Dutch oven and a shotgun all in one place. No wait... I can... Canadian Tire. Except the guns are much better here;)	3
The pollo fundido was very yummy. For this price point it exceeded my expectations.  Although exterior bathroom was inconvenient.	3
On par with similar places around Charlotte ( Bad Daddy's, etc).  Friend pickles were good and not over-salty like some places.  Burger was respectable and properly done.  Fries were good, hot.  Nice outdoor seating area.  Will go again.	3
I really loved the atmosphere stepping into this place. I have been learning German and what better way to brush up on my singing skills than visiting a German restaurant hall? The service was good but the real take home of the night was the Hefeweizen which was great. The potato soup, pretzels, and brats were tasty although the pretzels were a bit on the salty side for my taste. I was really looking forward to enjoying a loud atmosphere with singing and this place did not disappoint!	3
i came here because my car was getting worked on nearby and the staff recommended this place while they fixed my vehicle. the atmosphere was ok. the place could use a little update. you can tell its been there for awhile. i ordered the eggrolls and chicken fried rice. it was good and filling! i would come back here if im in the neighborhood again!	3
Moes is a burrito place with pretty much all custom orders.  Although I have experienced better, I did enjoy my veggie burrito and Negro Modelo.  They play the Grateful Dead and all sorts of Allman Brothers here, and some of the locations have crafty little quotes by these musicians.  The service wasn't shabby, but the people could have been a little bit more enthused, they must be getting minimum wage.	2
