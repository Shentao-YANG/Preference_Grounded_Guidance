As a Brit I take issue with their claim to be all things British - this is definitely an Americanised view of what British pub food would be.  American sports playing on the TVs, American decor etc.  That said, the music was certainly British and the food was top notch.  Very good service and good wine suggestions at decent prices, only minor criticism on the service being that we hadn't fished our starter by the time the main came out - they certainly like to move people in and out quickly.  We'd come again but not before we tried out other equivalent experiences.	2
Their coupons dinner for two could feed 3-4 people. Other than using a coupon for this restaurant, nothing really luring me here. I live nearby, so when I crave for prime rib, my first thought would be Texas Roadhouse but it's too far for instant gratification.  They do not have good salad nor appetizer, the shrimp cocktail is ridiculously small (3?). The side kicks aren't appealing. Maybe I'm just too damn picky on how to spend $50.	2
Its ok... a little tired, slots work well !!!!!!! Easy on sidewalk access	2
Green Chile Burrito Combo - excellent; meat well seasoned and the tortilla is stuffed with sauce and veggies.\nBreakfast Burrito -  Eggs, taters and stuff. Really good.\nSauces - Hot or mild they are very tasty.\nBlack Beans - best tasting part of the meal.\nWhite Rice - inviting...must have mayonnaise in there somewhere.\nService - Sometimes overwhelming but courteous and fast.\nNot a destintion restauant if you don't live close but well worth a visit.	2
Ok. They do not have anything vegetarian. Well, unless you want white rice. So, they were friendly and all, but obviously do your research before coming. I ended up ordering a coke before I realized I couldn't eat anything here and then just leaving. Lame!	2
Went here for  a snack right after the UNLV  REBELs  thrashed  top ranked BYU 88-74. \n\nI had the chicken marsala sandwich. It was very bland and lacked flavor. The ciabatta bread was too dense or thick for me. My friend had the Italian sub which did not look too appetizing. The pepperoni pizza was OK. Next time I will stick to the pizza. Do not even bother ordering anything else. Service was a little below average. We did not get our drinks refilled. The weird looking bus girl was a bit too detached from her duties. Not the best. Not the worst.	2
I always love this location , items in stock, prices are great, staff super nice , but today I used the ladies restroom and it looked like a college bachelor lived in there for a year! Toilet & sink were filthy , trash can overflowing kinda gross.  Kick it up a notch guys!!!!	2
Seriously underwhelmed by their sandwiches.  With a name like that, I was expecting something over-the-top great, but they delivered...just normal sandwiches that, at best, I would consider a decent but not great value.  In short, I'd never go out of my way to eat here...and even if I was passing by I'd have to think twice.	2
I didn't know what to think as this was my first time but I as well as my date were not impressed with the food or service. The burger was very dry and the French fries were awful. My date had a focaccia which was more of a wrap the focaccia and was ok. The server didn't want to be working it seemed. I gave it a 3 star as its ok but nothing special considering there are other choices in the area that are better in the sports grill area	2
this is a cool place which uses cocoa and chocolate in many of its dishes. the seasoned fries are pretty cool and they come dusted with cocoa powder\n\nthe pizza was ok. nothing too special. i didn't like the crust too much\n\nthe crepe was pretty good as well	2
We had a group of 12 head there for lunch. Only 8 of us stayed after the long wait (we had a reservation).\nWe didn't get our food until over an hour after we were seated.\nI ended up ordering an appetizer, which was pretty good. One of my friends sent her burger back because it had a funny smell. Everyone else enjoyed their food.\n\nThe server was pretty awesome. The hostess that seated us was sweet, but the other girls were surprisingly snooty.\n\nThe food was a tad overpriced.\n\nIt's not a bad place to grab a bit to eat downtown, but I don't see myself going there again.	2
Dr Fakhouri is amazing and the best but the front desk people are rude and incompetent.  They do not know what they are doing. They need to learn about customer service. They are the 1st people we see and they can lose client because of their bad attitude.	2
It was my first time going...Food trucks were the highlight for me.  Any and everyone is welcome and it clearly showed.  Felt a lot like Venice Beach with art and eclectic mixed in downtown LV.  One character who looked like he couldn't weigh 100 lbs wet walking around in camouflage pants with a skeleton body suit underneath who walks around and starts pop locking in the street...LOL.  We'll check it out again because we saw some cool stuff.  It was great to see such a huge, peaceful gathering.  Be prepared for mental stimulation.	2
They do a damn good job considering how crazy busy this place is! I fly in/out of this airport all the time and have only been delayed ONCE. Worst part is the line through security.. I've honestly waited 55 minutes (and nearly missed my flight). Line to checkin isn't too swell either. hence why I avoid checking bags. While we're on the negatives.. food kinda sucks here too.. HOWEVER, they are pretty damn effecient considering how busy they are.. that cab line efficiency will blow your mind.	2
Prices have gone up so Triple 7 isn't the bargain it once was for group dining.  There are some new menu items so we tried the pot stickers (small gyoza, not bad), battered and deep fried green beans (really good with the wasabi based dipping sauce but can't taste the green bean), and stuffed pork chops (ok pork chop but the stuffing's consistency was not good - like stuffing made into baby food.  Too full for dessert and only one visit to Triple 7 on this trip (used to be 2-3 visits, sigh).	2
It was okay ... Nothing impressive. Not worth the $$ I ordered the hamamazing crepe. Very little ham and Swiss cheese. Filled with more lettuce. Trying to be cheap...	1
Had reasonable expectations as I have been to many similar before.  Sadly I am disappointed.  The positive:  the ice cream is real and good with 6 choices.  The deserts are good too.  The hot food quality varies for nice baked salmon to half frozen oysters on half shell.  Shushi is average quality but fish sliced paper thin.	1
So I just stopped by as I was craving a banana split, and in the past, I've always gotten great ice cream there.  I know that they are pricier than other places, but I also know that it is typically worth it.  This time it wasn't!  I paid almost $11 for a banana split, and only got half of a banana......really?  Bananas are dirt cheap.  The ice cream came in a large box (got it to go), so there was plenty of room, but each side of the banana split had a quarter of a banana on it.....again, really???	1
I like Popeye 's Chicken. I'd like it a whole lot better if the prices were more in\nline with what you receive. Spendy for what you get,  in essence. If I drop $10\nfor a quick lunch, I shouldn't still be hungry after I eat it, just sayin '. Got something\nto say to Popeye 's - Pollo Mobile 2 - because That's  where I'm going next time\nI have a chicken craving. Popeye 's is a big fat burn.	1
They just reopened this spot, after months of renovation. Now it is a more proper sit down diner. You check in, the host seats you- that kind of thing. \n\nThe food is so mediocre, I'd eat at Carls, and Mc'Dees before here.	1
The food was good, the service was horrendous. Our waitress Carroll  literally kept forgetting about us. Took forever to even come to our table to take our drink order. By time she arrived we knew what we wanted to eat. We asked for a drink  menu, yet another long wait. Ordered our drinks. Another long weight. Asked us if we wanted dessert twice. I'm literally writing this as I wait for our check, it's that bad.	1
We did return and the pizza was even greasier than the first time. It took 3 paper towels to blot up all the grease. It was just too much. We will not be going back again.	1
I use to love this place for soup.  Now I find their soups are thin and never served very hot.  My wife took her soup to the microwave to get it so it was hot.  The staff is great and helpful but the quality of the food has really slipped.  I have tried several times and same bad results.  I guess it is time to find a new soup place.	1
My first expedience at a dinner movie theatre. Not very impressed. Very limited on the movie selection. Only 4 choices at a major downtown mall location. As a biz traveler, I'm looking for a good movie and popcorn. Dinner was expensive and lot of disruptions with meals delivered around me during the movie.\n\nI won't do a dinner movie again	1
This club is small and very crowded. The music is okay. The crowd is not that attractive. The only reason I would go to this club is for open bar or a guest that I REALLY wanted to see, but it's not terrible.	1
Every time I go here, I ask myself why!?\nThe Columbia outlet store is the only reason I head here, there isn't another in town. I like the Columbia outlet store but I seriously hate these outlets as a whole. Getting in and out is never easy. Even when it's not a holiday or weekend, parking is a nightmare. Always crowded, full of rude people. There's no airflow if you go on warmer days, it gets stuffy in those walkways. They're currently doing some sort of construction outside of the parking garage making things an even bigger cluster f***. I'll read this review every time I think I want to go to this outlet.	1
This place does not need to exist.\n\nPeriod.	1
Pretty good food, agreed on by party of three, but not so great service, even with only four booths occupied on a Saturday afternoon.	1
I had read great reviews and was excited to get my nails done at a nicer salon. They get an A+ on aesthetics and cleanliness. However, the people are rude, and my manicure and pedicure were just mediocre. The massage wasn't good and my french pedicure looked horrible. The lines were too thick and uneven. \n\nWhen it came to my nails the girl was rude and impatient and talked to the lady doing my pedicure the whole time. They also \"happened to run out\" of the additional color I wanted as soon as the girl sat down to do my manicure.  \n\nIt was WAY overpriced for such a mediocre experience.	1
2 stars is being generous. 1 star is for a great location in Old Montreal and the other star is because my wife likes their salt and pepper chicken wings.\nIt fails at being a sports bar. Sure they show a few games but they simultaneously pipe in Whitney Houston and Celine Dion greatest hits over the sound system.\nFood has no imagination, variety or taste.\nService and management are very weak.\nHave had several issues over the 5 times that I have been there with no satisfactory resolutions.\nWaste of a great location in Le Vieux Port!	1
After sending a letter to the hotel complaining about my awful experience they send me a letter apologizing and to show their generosity they offered me a free upgrade next time I stay in one of their bungalow suites... \n\nas sarah palin said re: the \"bridge to nowhere\": Thanks but no thanks.\n\none extra star for sending a letter instead of just ignoring me :P	1
I've been to the Roaring Fork 4 times.  Every time has been excellent.  Normally I get the roasted chicken which is outstanding but this time I tried their famous big ass burger.  It was excellent and aptly named.  Of course no meal here is complete without a side of green chili mac and cheese.  My friends had the salmon and fried chicken and said it was outstanding.  The service is excellent and so is the food. I see a 5th trip here in the near future.	4
Best place to eat breakfast in Phoenix, bold but well deserved. I stumbled across this fine establishment one Sunday morning and wasn't disappointed one bit after eating at local breeze. \n\nThe fire island eggs were amazing and complimented with a little green Tabasco sauce added the perfect touch.  The patio is huge and open creating the perfect setting for some sangria or mimosa whichever you prefer. They also offer a \"going green incentive\" with 15% off for bike riders on Sundays. \n\nKeep doing what your doing, because its right!	4
This is a gorgeous hotel! Everything about this hotel screams luxury. Love it.	4
Nice place close to home to have breakfast or lunch if you don't feel like cooking.  Tried the special, a Hawaiian burger with a turkey patty, was very delicious!  Other good was good too.  Kids chicken fingers and biscuits and gravy.	4
Ok.... This is by far the place to go if you want authentic local food.  Their ox tail is to die for and their Chantilly cake and cocoa puffs just like liliha on Oahu.  I'm very picky when in comes to food...... And I rate this the best!	4
Joe is the best!  He is very passionate about massage and very educated.	4
Sin city smashburgerrrr... yum \nLove this place. Seems like its always busy so you might have to wait. I usually pick up because the tables are full. \nVeggie frites are awesome and the chocolate malts too.	4
Dr. Sauter is great. He never pushed any interventions on me as a patient and was very accepting of my birth plan as well as supportive to the fact I wanted a natural unmedicated low intervention childbirth. Unfortunately he wasn't available to deliver my baby when I did go into labor but his partner was. I definitely would recommend him as an OB.	4
My friends and I almost come here every time we come to Vegas.  Sandwiches are cheap yet super filling, and there is a wide variety as well.  Although there's a fairly long line every time I've come here, it goes by pretty quickly and you don't wait too long for your order too.  I suggest this place if you want to grab a quick meal and don't want to spend much (especially in Vegas).  There's also a large seating area so you can also enjoy your sandwich right then and there.	4
After spending a few days in Montreal and asking many people what boutiques I should check out I found myself repeating \"yes, I have been to reborn\" over and over again. Even if you aren't in a shopping mood its worth checking out. The jewelry and other artifacts where fantastic. The pieces by Natalia Brilli where particularly unique and interesting. The women who I gather owns the place was very nice and helpful. Check out their website too... it is under-construction but has some great photos of their clothes in the store. A must see in Montreal.	4
Such a good burger place.  I love a place that gives you options and they give you tons.  I chose their Buffaloaded Bison burger which was great.  They also have amazing shakes.  I got a hard shake and the liquor taste was a tad on the strong side, however, my friends caramel and pretzel shakes were delish.  I would highly recommend this place for some good times and good food.	4
The food is very good. Try the Migo Burrito. Very good. The fish tacos were great. Price is competitive. Friendly staff and nice and cool AC. I will be back soon.	4
Went a few days ago. Medium Whole Shabang was SPICAY!!! Thanks for kicking it up a notch. \n\nBIB ME!!! \n\nThey still don't have a liquor license, but you can B.Y.O.B. if you have the receipt.	4
Awesome all you can eat yummy & sake. Good fresh and my fav sushi place.	4
Environment is calm and collective. Employees are helpful and my massage was awesome!! Will definitely come back!	4
I went this place sever times always fresh clean verity they get about 35 kind sushi with color full and tasty fresh raw sashimi and tampura and raw fresh oyster the is surprise me all . Four season salad soft ice cream and convince Ice in the cup great for the kid really thought full  and the fruit and cookie even the had pizza and dinner roll with butter yummy!!! Now we starting with hot and delicious dish like general tao's chicken ,chicken with broccoli and crab and dumplin and hot'n soul soup and clam chowder there was too many item to describe you get to check out this place amazing	4
I took my car for  an inspection after just moving to Hburg and looking for a new mechanic. The guy behind the counter barely spoke and the one who performed my inspection came out after 20 mins to let me know I would need to purchase new windshield wipers from them to pass. Of course I was between a rock and a hard place, having to pay either way at this point. My wipers were the expensive brand and rarely used btw. So I bought theirs paying $22 which ended up being super cheap and do not work. Very disappointed and will not be going back. No wonder I never see cars in their parking lot.	0
The food was w/e but the staff were unbearable. Never again.	0
Worst petco ever bad cashier rude will never go back and i don't recommend to anyone!!	0
Only open a couple of months. closed	0
Wow!!! Very upsetting. Got greeted great and that's where it ended. Sat us at our table. Waited over 7 mins and not one person even came over to our table. Got up and left. Told the nice girl at the front, she tried to get us back to sit down but I wasn't about to return after waiting. If you are going to charge that kind of money for your food, your service better be top notch. Not what I expected for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. I know it's a Saturday night at 11 but you should give the same service no matter what time it is. I hope this is not normal. I would like to try it again maybe sometime.	0
If you are looking for ugly people, disgusting food and cheap alcohol, this is your spot.	0
I used to come here as a child and I remember it being a beautiful lush green park. It was such a nice place to picnic and spend time with your family. Now that I am older, I had taken my family to the park and I was extremely disappointed. The park was so dirty. The grass was completely covered in bird poop. No trash cans. There is also an entry fee to get in which is so sad because the neighborhood park looks better than Floyd Lamb.	0
Horrible experience! There's hair on my boyfriend's sandwich, and this asian lady goes \"that's not hair, it's cheese!\". Later on she still insisted \"that's hair but it's not human hair!\" I don't freakin care what kind of hair it is, i just want our money back! She offered another sandwich, how can you stomach another sandwich? This place is nasty and horrible. Please save yourself from headache and leaving on an empty stomach. Do NOT go here.	0
Do not waste your money or time. Went here on a recommendation, do not waste your time unless you think a square piece of frozen fish that they cook for you is good, the shrimp terrible. Staff was rude, asked for ketchup with my fry's was told to go to the store and get some if I wanted it. Was not expecting anything great, but did expect a little more than pre made frozen processed fish and shrimp. At least Long John Silvers and Captain D's batter their own. Could not even eat my meal it was that bad.	0
Buyer beware! I recently bought 1/2 pound smokes salmon. The counter is set up so you cannot see them slicing the fish. I must have received the last pieces because when he was done he threw out the carcass. When I opened my package at home the pieces were hard and dried out. I returned the next day and explained what happened to Frank, the owner, requesting a replacement.  In an unpleasant tone he told me, too bad, someone has to get the end pieces. These are not honest people and they don't care about their customers.	0
Mark our waiter was the worst I have ever had in Vegas. It's a shame that the bus boy had to do all the work. He was much better than the waiter. Mark had the personality of a rock. Food was average.	0
I travel frequently and this was by far the worst service I have ever had. 15 minutes after I was seated- a waitress finally acknowledged me. Another 5 minutes passed and she asked if I wanted \"sumpin to drink\"--- took my order and promy let me know she was going on break and to flag down somebody if I needed \"sumpin\".  Go somewhere else---	0
Now waiting one hour past appointment time.  I like my doctor, but something needs to be done about scheduling appointments. Last time I waited close to 3 hours and I didn't even get to the doctor.	0
Upgraded to too in North tower. Ok, but not worth the extra $20 a night; gave me a discount coupon for the gym/spa, which the spa wouldn't accept; charged my room $25 for dry cleaning I didn't get and wouldn't credit me at checkout. Stay away from this place unless you want to get ripped off.	0
This place is now closed.	0
Very annoying young staff yelling alot also in that whiny girl voice. Wifi and reception stinks as well. Not a good place to conduct business as they don't clean the tables or floors either. Damn..they won't shutup. Gotta leave.	0
After my second visit to Cathay House for Dim Sum, I'm giving them another star.  The food is excellent, the service is speedy and the prices are very reasonable.	3
Really cool place with great views.  I stayed here and got a great bottle deal with my room. Only warning for folks during the hot vegas summer months, the artificial turf gets stupid hot. You must wear shoes and not go barefoot or it will burn your feet	3
Not bad for Taco Bell. Happier Hour has great deals. Aura and Rose are two front end rock stars in my opinion.	3
This is an amazing restaurant. I've never had better service and the 3 course lunch is awesome. We have family members that go to Rosemary's every time they come to Vegas and we were lucky enough to tag along this last time. I don't think there is a dish you could go wrong with honestly. I really enjoyed the cheesecake and carrot cake. :) \nI'd give this 5 stars, but my husband and I are compromising with a 4 star rating since he didn't enjoy it as much.	3
Had a really nice time at this location. I booked it through an Amazon deal but realized there wasn't that big of a price difference between\nLSI regular rates and the Amazon deal.  As for the perks that were supposedly included I could have gotten on my own. Anyways aside from that I loved the junior suite and balcony overlooking the strip. It was really clean and the jacuzzi tub was the perfect size.  On top of that the hotel is connected to the MGM, Signature etc. so there wasn't a need to drive anywhere. Just pack some cute walking shoes, head on out and get your on!	3
ok but the mushy peas are terrible	3
A great taste of Chicago-style Greek right here in Phoenix! Love the Gyros platter with the rice and greek lemon potatoes. In addition to the gyros the cheesecake is to die for!	3
Another great restaurant in the Cosmopolitan!  The service was great, the decor was rustic, but comfortable and the food was delicious!  The margherita pizza was amazing accompanied with a glass of prosecco - pure heaven!	3
Went there for lunch. The wait wasn't that bad. It only took us ten minutes to get a seat outside. The atmosphere was great especially when the bellagio fountain is right across the street. Food was decent, but it was reaaaaalllllyyyyyy slow.	3
I use the groomers here every month. They are always very nice, and do a consistent job on my pup. The store is clean? And I was able to get help when I had some questions about dog products. \n\nI have been approached a few times in the parking lot by wandering people asking for money, which is a lil annoying.	3
In and out in no time.....  If you are looking for a quick car inspection without blowing half the day waiting in line go here.  I usually go Saturday mornings (early) to avoid the rush, but they seem to handle the 20 guy rush in the mornings (I guess great minds do think alike).\n\nThe waiting room was recently revamped with a tv and chairs... before it looked kinda bad and dingy... like I haven't been cleaned in 20 years dingy.  You don't really spend too much time in the waiting room anyway, but at least it's an option.	3
Great place to go for a movie!! Food was good and pricing was fair and can't go wrong with the service. First time there and will go back again and again and again.	3
We needed to redo our back yard and being new to AZ didn't have a clue about local plants.  Our visit to DH was very informative;  employee took us to the plants that would suit our needs...sun, shade, etc....and explained the facts about each one.  We decided on some plants and had them delivered and planted.  The crew was polite and thorough....we did have an issue but DH was great about taking care of it.   Very satisfied with them.	3
The Peanut Butter cookies are to die for! The service is great and the place is clean! Win win! The brownie cookie was a little too hard for my taste but everything else's was delicious!	3
Our family was passing through Vegas and wanted yummy Asian food. Yelped and read many good reviews. We liked this little family owned spot. Though we didn't get to try the bim bam bap the BBQ mix plate was a delicious alternative.	3
Located next to the lobby area of Well Fargo 3, this little coffee shop is fantastic. They always seem to have unique roasts from the world's most popular coffee regions. I'm not sure who does the roasting or where they buy their beans but it is easily better than Caribou and Starbucks.\nI have only had two of the pastry offerings and they were also worth the money as a breakfast. It is kind of tucked away but if you are on that side of Uptown, consider trying to find it. You won't be disapointed.	3
From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the giant breakfast burrito is delicious and huge!!!	2
