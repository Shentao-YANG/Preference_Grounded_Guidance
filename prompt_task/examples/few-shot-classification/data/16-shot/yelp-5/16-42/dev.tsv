restaurant is closed and not open for business anymore.	0
Stopped into Gigi's yesterday, won't be going back anytime soon.. \n\nCupcakes look and taste like they been on the display shelves for days as the cake and frosting appeared to be on the VERY dry side..	0
It looks like all of the bogus orange head 5 star reviews couldn't save this place. I saw that the sign was no longer there and the place was closed for lunch on Friday.	0
Very disappointing. We made a reservation for 12 of us at 7:00pm on a Friday night. The atmosphere and bull riding is the highlight of this place. Our waitress tried very hard, but after 2 hours we still did not have our food? We ordered chicken fingers and onion rings, really 2 hours. After the first hour they put the order back through and said it should come right out, after another hour we finally asked the manager what was going on and his response was \"sorry\" these things happen. No comp on anything. We then went over to Buffalo Chip and had our food in 15 minutes. Will not be back and will let all of our local friends know.	0
Hole in the wall restaurant, went here for the lunch buffet, and really did not like the food, it was very dry and did not have any flavor, staff was rude, won't be back, and you shouldn't go either.	0
Horrible food...tasteless!! NY style Deli..obviously you never been to NY..My husband and I ordered pastrami ...it had no flavor and was like rubber..the side potato salad..bland and the pasta salad was a joke...tasted like just boiled pasta.  I would not recommend this restaurant...	0
Food poisoning my first time (and now last) eating here. Stay away if you value your health! One star only because yelp doesn't allow you zero.	0
Horrible service. Waiting for almost 3 hours just to get discharged. I don\"t understand why they are included.in the 100 best hospitals. Please re review.	0
Went to studio to take my first class after paying a week ago and the Landlord had a post that they haven't paid rent and locked them out. They are out of business and I am out of money. Yet Yelp has a great offer for you to pay $75 for $100 of worthless classes. Should keep up to date.	0
The female Jersey shore look alike bartender on Fridays is for sure snorting something, and watch out for her to scratch her crouch before pouring your drink.	0
I would highly recommend not living here.  The staff is terribly with contact and ignores its residents.  The complex is brand new as of 2011 and the maintenance staff is letting is go quickly--from not keeping freon in the a/c units to ignoring repair requests for leaks to simply marking maintenance requests as completed.  The management does not seem to be concerned with training the staff whatsoever.  Natalie was especially difficult to work with and very forgetful.  If you're looking for a nice place to live, cross this one off your list before you end up with all these headaches.	0
If I could give a negative review I would. I went in to get all you can eat. Food isn't half bad, but the service is horribly slow. And honestly, for ayce, speed is of the essence. I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes for a few rolls of my first round. I've been waiting over 25 freaking minutes and some rolls still haven't come. \n\nWhat gives?\n\nEdit: they finally came. 30 minutes later. Really? For salmon rolls?	0
Sweet and sour chicken was horrible. We will never come back here again. Not authentic Asian food at all. Very disappointed. Not worth my $$ at all!!	0
Management reorg needed ASAP! This place would be so much better if someone that worked there actually took pride in their job. Over priced food that was just okay tasting. Ordered a piece of party it's like your birthday cake for dessert, it had finger prints of the person that cut it then grabbed it with his/her hand and placed it on the plate. I should've read the other reviews before wasting $75. The table next to us sent back a plate as well, not at all what we expected. Very disappointed. I've worked in the restaurant business and most horrible restaurants are due to poor management... Not coming back here again.	0
This is probably the most overrated buffet in Vegas. I heard good things about this place when they first opened, but when I visited a week ago for dinner, it was overcrowded with very long lines on the meat and seafood stations. I had to wait more than 15 minutes on the seafood station line! And for what?! Crab legs that were overcooked and oysters that smelled like women's makeup! The meat station was little better but it did not make up for other shortcomings.	0
I hate Las Vegas. This is vintage hateful Las Vegas. A warehouse for smoking cigarettes, downing squishy Mai Tai's, and moving money around in circles. I have about seven thousand plastic beads from this place, and I get burnt out just thinking about them. You could stay here forever because they have ridiculously low limit tables and the cocktail waitresses are super hyperactive.	2
Decent food but was totally dead inside at 6pm on a Thursday.  Cant really think of anything they offer that I cant get elsewhere in South Phoenix.  Had some chips and salsa and a green chile pork burrito.  Good homemade flavor to it.	2
Walking into Atomic 7 can be overwhelming but the staff is helpful in making selections. Treats are made on the spot so you can customize for dietary needs. This is what brought me in. My mom is diabetic and desparately misses sweets. She's had a mean craving for a pina colada so they made her a tropical smoothie with Agave. It was good, but she missed the pineapple flavor this mainly tasted like coconut and banana. I had the Waffly Good ice cream. It was awfully good. Since it's made on site the waffle pieces remain supremely crisp.	2
They are perfectly average. You get what you ask for in a short time and the food is hot and fresh. They do not charge extra for brown rice. \n\nThe lunch deal 2 for 10.99 is decent. 2 bowls two salads two drinks.	2
Very nice guy. Very interesting place. Haircut wasn't great, but the experience was entertaining.	2
This Lee's is smaller than others in the wine section as well as in the beer section. The staff like to sit and talk about what your buying and why your buying it witch is nice sometimes but often leads to long lines and the quick \"in and out\" stop now takes about 30 min.	2
I've been to this location 2 times. While their maple bacon donuts are VERY delicious, both times I have gone to get a Ham and Cheese Croissant. It's right there on their menu-\n(http://www.rainbowdonutscafe.com/croissants.html). Yet both times they didn't have any. So this time I asked \"Do you still make them\", and her response was \"Every once in a while\". WHAT!?\n\nNote to Rainbow: Don't put something on your menu that you don't regularly serve. \n\n\nI won't be heading back even though the maple bacon donuts are yummy.	2
I come here a lot for convenience sake, but it is not my favorite store. It's really feast or famine here. Sometimes they are very well stocked, like during the holidays or just before the season changes and other times there is nothing there to browse through. \n\nI often leave empty handed or head next door to Marshall's because they don't always have the most orderly lines or efficient checkout process.	2
This is an okay Chinese bakery located in the Chinatown plaza. The sun biscuit I had was huge (the size of my face), but the interior of the biscuit didn't quite taste like the sun biscuits I am used to. The buo luo bao did not look that appetizing. The egg crust looked kind of dry and there didn't seem to be much egg on it.	2
Food was okay. Had the Aloha Bento.  The beef was tough.  Chicken and fish were good.	2
What do you expect?  I wavered from my usual Club and had the Buffalo Chicken to.  Not bad.  Not great.\n\nI am glad they finally switched the kids meal bags.  We have way too many of them.\n\nThey added more seating outside.	2
I think I had the Beach Salad with chicken pre-flight. It was actually pretty good, as the waitress recommended.	2
Ok, so to answer Aimees question, the low reviews are probably a reflection of the crappy service!\n\nProducts are displayed as a color scheme, which is visually inviting, well for me, and I believe that certain pieces in your clothing collection can be pulled of if its a store bought cheapie! \n\nThis store is cheap... really cheap, I once spent $80 and left with a dress, a jacket, a pair of shoes and accessories, which could also be relatable to forever 21 as far as it relates to merchandise quality. \n\nBut the service is the store SUCKS, I mean, JUST REALLY SUCKS.\nIts a good thing I have alot of patience.	2
I ordered a salad and that was good. My friend had the braised rib and it was yummy. Braised rib must be a common dish in this area as they have it on a few menus at the restaurants in the area. \n\nWe ordered a couple of desserts that were good. \n\nService was lacking. I know we were sitting in the bar area, but waited forever to order after we said we needed one more minute.	2
Ordered delivery from there tonight. Good, tasty, a ton of fries (more than I can eat but my roommate is going to be a happy man because of it) and well cooked chicken. \n\nMy only complaint, which is a fairly big one, is that I ordered mozzarella sticks for 6,95 and they arrived cold, hard and were somehow accompanied with a piece of banana, cantaloupe, and orange. Having mozzarella sticks that taste like orange was not enjoyable whatsoever and just really bizarre. I wouldn't have ordered them had I known.\n\nQuick delivery, the guy was really nice.	2
Entertaining show on The Strip. Sit up high if you don't want to get wet with paint or covered with streams of TP.	2
Went here on a friday night and had a awesome time with my friends .great eighties bands was playing and they were entertaining.  Will return	3
So, I've given it a few more tries and there's no denying they make great espresso. They're also very friendly. The only thing holding me back from a higher rating is that I'm not a fan of live music in coffee shops. It's a bit intrusive and awkward, however, that's simply my opinion.	3
Went to Vegas for a bachelor party. My co-worker (bachelor) and his friends have a ritual to goto Smith and Wollensky everytime someone gets married. We sat in a special room that looked inside the kitchen. The large floor to cieling glass that separated us and the kitchen made a very quiet dinner possible. I ordered the rib eye steak, medium rare, and it came out delightful. My only complaint would be that the steak had a little more fat than I wanted and not enough meat.	3
Good service, good food.  Par with other Red Robin's we've been to!	3
Asia Tea House is super conveniently located- I'd come here all the time, even if the food wasn't good. The spring rolls and vegetarian tofu is always top notch. The veggies are cooked well and the portions are huge. I love trying all the different bubble teas here. \n\nThe only word of caution I have is that the General Tso's tofu here just flat out isn't General Tso's. It's honestly just watery nonsense, so if you're going for tofu, get the vegetarian tofu instead.	3
I have nothin' but love for this place. Fond memories of 40oz. paper cups of beer that you'd drink by yourself, Pat McCurdy, bratwurst, movie nights and just plain hot, sticky Wisconsin summer nights. Just get there early, or you'll be standing and I'm docking the Terrace a star for replacing the 40oz. cups with those stupid pitchers.	3
This place is a great alternative to Todai on the strip.  If you have the ability to drive to the outlets, I would recommend this place because 1.  You dont have to fight the traffic on the strip 2. the food is just as good as Todai...maybe even a better selection of sushi 3.  You can shop before or after at the Outlets ( a perk for your female companion)	3
Make sure if you're staying at The Luxor to check out the $20 off coupon in the check-in booklet. This place is great for 2 people to share sushi and a dish. My colleague and I shared 3 rolls (wicked roll is good) and the chicken lo mein. Two guys had plenty to eat and walked out full. Service is so-so but the food is above average. I come from spoiled CA sushi, so yeah. Enjoy!	3
Very good quality food, made fresh to order and extremely affordable.    Rather small inside, but personal and laid back.    The garlic naan and mango lessi were extremely good, and we really enjoyed the Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Bangab Bharta (eggplant).    \n\nIn the corner of a strip mall, so it is a little hard to find, but definitely worth the effort for authentic food at great prices.	3
Great breakfast food, great staff - very friendly and helpful!  Instead of having a boring hotel breakfast, drove 20 minutes and made a good call. Blankets are available if it is a tad chilly outside. \n\nWhould have given 5 stars if our food came out a little faster, but I think it was a small snafu and not a common thing..\n\nI had a yummy Bananas Fosters French Toast, and my wife a Sonara Hash which was great with salsa..	3
Pick Up Stix is another \"fast\" Chinese restaurant.  Not as fast as a Panda Express, but more like a Pei Wei with a more casual atmosphere.  The give very generous portions, with lots of veggies.  I frequently order sweet and sour chicken at any Chinese restaurant, and this was one of the best.	3
Obviously you have to be lucky and be at the laugh factory when there's someone funny there,  I've seen some really funny comedians here,  Gallagher put me to sleep,  basically a crabby old guy,  he ended with \" this is my last joke \" .\nI was happy I didn't have to listen to his stupid jokes anymore.	3
This was one of the highlights of my trip to Montreal (similar to Angela C.). I love going to grocery stores in different areas to check out the different foods they have. Their dessert section looks amazing with all the fancy and yummy looking cakes. I purchased some grain cheese (curds) which I've never had until I came to Montreal. I also bought 4 mini Guadet pies as they were on sale and they were so delicious!! Looking back, I wish I bought the larger size as they were a better deal but I had no idea they would be that tasty. One thing I found odd was that they didn't have any chapstick.  Oh well, no big deal.	3
I stopped and had lunch at chucks today, and they are very friendly and good ole meat and 2 with tea and free cup of soup.\nthey also open at 5:30 am so if you are on your way to work say at 6:30 you can swing by  and grab a breakfast  samich!	3
Awwww. What a cute little park! There is even a little pond...and a softball and football field. So quiet.	3
Reasonably priced burrito compared to Filibertos. \n\nGet the California burrito. Super tasty. Open all day.\n\nThe Cali Bureet is a carne asada based burrito with french fries in it. Super tasty and an excellent value.	3
Perfection every time! I love the ahi tuna tacos, and the short ribs are incredible too! Top 5 in town for me!	4
I researched many a firm before hiring Skiba Law to assist with a Collection suit.  Mr. Skiba and his staff have gone above and beyond my expectations, making themselves available to answer questions regarding a collection suit I was involved in.  I was able to meet with him very quickly, to start process on my suit.  He's been a consummate professional at every turn.  All the fears I had associated with the difficult situation I was in, were quelled by John and his staff.  If ever I need assistance again, I would hire him in a heartbeat.	4
The pizza these guys make is fantastic. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere nice a chill. These guys are vegan friendly which is a plus.	4
After walking around the Forum Shops because i came in town to see my parents for my birthday we showed up here. We didnt have a reservation and they seated us anyway without griping or bitching and moaning. What a experience it was. From the bread to the Teriyaki Chicken i had which was massive and not badly priced either. And both my parents had nice sized entrees too. Next time im back in Nevada i will have to make a reservation and enjoy the food and customer service again.	4
It's probably my favorite pizza in Arizona.  They use great ingredients and you can just taste the quality.  It costs more than most places, but that's because it's good and they pay more for better quality ingredients.  It's worth it.	4
Hidden Jewel in dtphx!  Perfect spot to grab a super tasty lunch or dinner before a Suns or Dbacks game.  This place is in the old Cartel spot.  It is cozy but comfortable and inviting.  Both times I have dined there the staff is super friendly.  The pizza is AMAZING.  I would rank local joints like this: \n1) Bianco's\n2) La Piazza Locale\n3) Federal Pizza\n4) The Parlor\n5) Cibo\n6) Pomo\nSo since Bianco's is ranked nationally this place is holding its own in a close 2nd.  \nCheck it out ASAP.	4
This place is awesome! Everything is fresh, including the pasta. My friend and I shaqred a lasagna and a salad, we ended up getting an extra of each to bring home. With the Yelp deal that's aqvailable, it was incredibly cheap. We're going bqck next week.	4
Awesome! This place is so cute and they made balloons for the kids when they asked for one :)	4
With as much as I eat here, I'm surprised I haven't given them a review. Whenever I feel like pizza I always order from here. I order online because I have a daughter who likes to yell and scream and it is just so much easier. The order time is always accurate, I LOVE the tracker, and the delivery men are also so nice and polite. I used to go to pizza hut, but after having tons and tons of problems with the pizza-cold, gross, and skimpy toppings; I convinced my husband to let me order dominos and we have never turned back... he just wishes they had a better deep dish crust- which i dont mind either way :)	4
The only Dog Park in the Metro Phoenix area with a beach front so your dog can play in the water. Lots of big dogs but the owners and their pets seem well socialized. To see some photos and my complete review visit http://www.dogparkriot.com	4
Best ground beef enchiladas in the valley.  The red sauce is to die for and they are not affiliated with the chain Garcia's so no disgusting food drowning in oil here.  \n\nI have been coming here since the 90's and sometimes drive out of my way from Tempe to get their enchiladas.  \n\nThey also have another building on the same property that has a drive through serving the same food as the restaurant.	4
I was pleasantly surprised by the level of professionalism at this location. I was helped by Russell who found a nail in one of my tires. He did a tire check and told me my tires were in great shape.  I asked him for information in the future on what would be good replacements once my tires were worn. He educated me on which tires would be a good value and what fitted my lifestyle. Also which type of tires could and couldn't be repaired.  I recommend this location.	4
Everything I was hoping it would be!  Guy rocks!  Best breakfast in Vegas!  The burrito, the stuffed pancakes, the French toast and the famous loaded Bloody Mary's were all best in class.  Table service was first rate.  But how about some XXL t-shirts?  C'mon man!!!	4
One of the best buffets in town.  Very affordable for lunch ($9.99) for quality Indian food and fresh baked naan.  What a bargain.  Definitely coming back.	4
I took my quite persnickety almost 4 year old for his first real haircut (not by mommy) and he did so well thanks to Lori putting him at ease. She definitely gained a loyal customer!	4
Oh Bangkok 9.\nI miss living around the corner  from you.\n\nEvery time I've ordered or dined in here, I've had great service, and great food.\n\nThe Golden Bags are a revelation.\nI love curry...my favorites are the yellow, the panang, and the masaman.  \n\nI'm going to have to go back soon, I'm craving good curry!	4
Going out of business. Run! Grab all the commercial shelving you could possibly need before the vultures come and strip the place!	1
This place keeps getting worse every time I visit. For starter's, their slices are overpriced, as are the entire pizzas. Secondly, I find the sauce too sweet. The empanadas are ok, nothing to write home about. \n\nFinally, every time I've been here, the service has been bizarre. It seems like the staff is high. They aren't necessarily rude, just clueless. Also, they like to change the rules on their \"deals\", which I personally find annoying. Also, they often have buddies hanging out which makes the cramped space even smaller. The only reason I go here occasionally is  because it's near my building.	1
This is a great place to see a movie. But try getting your soda and popcorn in a timely manner. forget it! One person selling tickets. Two people taking tickets. One person at concession. With a line of 8 to 10 people! Manager must be sleeping in the back. Get your act together!	1
Just like the rating. Meh.\nBaristas look like they are bored out of their minds.\nMy friend wanted to inquire about their free Tall Hazelnut macchiato, and boy were they sour about it. They decide to honor the promotion, like they should, and gave my friend her free drink. I bought a venti sized, and was given what? Caramel macchiato.\nDisappointed for sure, and I won't be coming back, mainly cuz I live in Southern California.	1
OVER PRICED! I have found during my 2 trips, items with 'Desert Industries' priced stickers (competitor thrift store) one item was marked several bucks over the competitors.  The other item I unknowingly purchased since this time they were smart enough to cover the original price and I ended up paying double! I have found some good items.  I know I could get similar items a little cheaper but my last visit with that covered sticker definitely was my last. You can rip someone else off. Do they have people buy items from other thrift stores to sell in their own...?\nGoodwill and Desert Industries down the street are worth your time and money.	1
Service was slow. Ordered a nonfat chai latte with shot of espresso, not too complicated. The chai was bitter due to the herbs not being strained out which also made it gritty- a very unpleasant texture in a drink. The only pluses about this place is the decor & patio. Didn't try any food but it looked good.	1
It was very anticlimactic to visit the pawn shop.  It was basically just a big tourist spot with everyone taking pictures and buying Chumlee T-shirts.  We only got to hang out here for 5 minutes before they closed it to film, and they kick everyone out.  When we left all these cab drivers bugged us to see if we needed rides.  If you are a die hard fan and want a t shirt maybe it's worth a stop, otherwise just drive by and take a picture of the outside.	1
I have given this place 2 stars and the reason is because of the service and speed of food. The food quality was great, fries was good but the wait for food and our server was awful. My gf stated that if our server would have smiled it would have been a miracle. Again the food was good.. The service was awful	1
I've been here a few times now and haven't really been able to find an entr\u00e9e that I would order again. Not much of it seems to have a fresh taste. The pizza is probably the best thing on the menu. \n\nThey always seem busy so maybe it's just me.	1
A beer while you wait us cool, but getting 3-4 strips of steak and 1 cheese crisp sized tortilla is very disappointing when ordering a fajita meal. Honestly could've got more at Taco Bell. I don't know why I didn't remember my last bad experience there. Ugh!	1
The new terminal is awesome, and if you arrive in the morning, the taxi line is nonexistant.  It still smells of desperation and shame when you step off the plane and see all the last minute gamblers pulling away at the one-armed bandit.	1
The food and service were great, but the music was so loud you couldn't talk without yelling, but it was a Saturday night, I can understand that. What really got to me though was the lanes were not properly waxed so you couldn't slide and it would seem the AC was broken. My friends and I kept going outside to cool down. Several of us asked for the AC to be turned down and we were told the AC was broken, which is horrible is Phoenix. Overall I'd go to party there, but as a bowling alley, I'd go somewhere else.	1
This theatre was the only place we found showing a NY Philharmonic event (Company) and ah boy, did we get the worst theatre and projector.  The chairs hadn't been cleaned, the room was somewhere between small and tiny, and the worst part -- the projector had a scanline that went up and down the entire showing.  \n\nFor $18 I was expecting THX and HD projection, not to be kicked in the knee.  If it wasn't the only place in town to see it and if I'd known it was going to be that bad... ugh, this place.	1
Southern Bell was the best but the cupcakes were kind of dry... Won't go back again. Cute but not very good, unfortunately.	1
I want a jim and coke in pint glass....no we dont serve like that.....well wont come back ever. ..such not  a big deal....	1
there ok	1
Used to love this place. Lately it has been dead, the staff seems to have all been fired or moved to obscure shifts.\n\nThe new staff is terse, douchey, and seems bent on alienating the regulars. The pub quiz they host on Wednesday used to be fun but the new host is deadpan and as interesting as a watching a corpse decay. Also don't host a quiz if you cannot pronounce Quixote correctly.\n\nThe food was good, but when I go somewhere to unwind, I will someplace else from now on. I wonder if the owner will notice the huge chain of 1 star reviews lately and get a clue.	0
