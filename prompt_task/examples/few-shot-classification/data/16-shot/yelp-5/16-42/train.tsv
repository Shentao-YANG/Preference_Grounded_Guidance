I went in for a wax. Perhaps that was my mistake; maybe they just Polish...not wax. Either way, be weary. The woman who walked me used huge clunky chunks of wax and pulled like a pansy.  I could have done it better myself.  I was miserable and in pain.	0
I always try to give this UPS store my business for its close to home but every time I've been in the employees always have a chip on their shoulder - dude I'm just trying to mail something and its your job to help me get that done!  Terrible customer service.  They could be a lot nicer.  I prefer to use FedEX but sometimes I need to use UPS so I will go to the other UPS store on Indian School from now on - they are super nice - shouldn't every store be like that!	0
Very rude and horrible customer service! I will NEVER visit this location again. This place should get 0 stars, but Yelp wouldn't allow it.	0
Always raising prices on us as well as the worst customer service over the phone... fighting with us about how they have the best everything and really they don't we are no longer customers with them!	0
Lets talk about popcorn.  The worst popcorn is served here.  The amer..Dental Association must give them money to serve this popcorn.  Cinemark popcorn is really good. Only one cashier to sell tickets, 7 people serving food.  The lines were very long on Tuesday.  The theatres are fine.	0
Ok this really sucks to have to do this but yet again my order was horrible! This place is awesome 50% of the time but I'm sorry- for these prices & the simplicity of the dishes - the order should be perfect!\nToday is by far the worst it's been yet - everything is either undercooked or overcooked! Needless to say we won't be ordering from here anymore - such a shame	0
Horrible place- stay away. Filthy hallways, ice machines all broken, graffiti in elevator. My room smells like dog piss. There was dog poop on the hallway floor by Pepsi machine. This place is awful. Stay away!	0
I was given a gift card and decided to take the family to lunch. This was a disappointing experience. The waiter never told us about the daily specials. He wasn't  very knowledgable about the menu and he didn't clear the salad plates before bringing out the entrees. My husband had to make room for the entrees while the waiter stood there with hot plates in his hand. Now on to the food. I know exactly why I don't dine at OG. The salad tasted as if it had been in the fridge for days and the pasta had been microwaved too long. The bread sticks were loaded with salt.Never again!	0
Way too over-rated. 20mn wait despite reservation. Service was all about speed, we felt like we had to be out of there asap. Food was very average. Tartare was dry, papardelle overcooked... No savor. Very bad value for money, definitely not worth $240 for 2. Our only disappointing experience all week-end in Vegas.	0
Lame. \nDisappointment. \nOverpriced. \nSmall. \nTerrible service.\nWish I never went. \nThe only thing I found amusing was that the cup was made of ice.	0
Garbage...I would rate food 3 but service brought it down to one....Garbage...go to suri ayce...rate Suri 3 but service brings in to 4	0
Horrible service; food is marginal.  Went on a Sunday for lunch with 6 friends and our waitstaff didn't inform us of specials, didn't want to answer menu questions, and knew nothing about the gluten free menu.  She brought us a wrong order and acted offended when it was returned.  We won't be back.  Save your $ and find a better restaurant with decent service.	0
We were there on Saturday and were shocked to learn that no tasting menu available because thet were too busy. Yeah right, if there's no tasting menu, then post it on the website so we would not have gone! The food is just so so; the foie gras was a bit tough, the mac and cheese was a huge disappointment and the filet was tasteless. The best thing is the view. For really good food, try Aureole instead. Been there three times and never been disappointed.	0
Se horrible!  I can't believe how cold the fries are! My chicken sandwich had the smallest amount of chicken I've ever seen on a sandwich. The salad was served without sauce. Nichols served were cold with little cheese. I'd skip this one if I were you.	0
I just purchased a groupon for a manicure for my girlfriend, when she gets there to make an appointment there is a handwritten sign on the door stating that they are not accepting groupons and to not come in and bother the stylists. I cannot believe how rude that sign is. I took a picture and will never send anyone there.	0
Food is OK, the duck is a bit too sweet for me, even without the duck sauce. The veggies are well, what you expect for plain veggies. The noodle soups are OK as well.  Been here twice and will go again when we want moderate priced foods. Oh, the congee was not great either...just over seasoned. Simple is better.	2
It's a fast food Hamburger Joint.  That being said, the service here is better than the hamburger joint across the street.	2
Very Americanized thai food! I would recommend: Weera Thai or Thai Style Noodle House. I had the panang curry and it was very bland... if you are not used to spicy food or if you don't really like authentic Thai then this place is probably best for you. If you are used to eating a lot of asian food and like a little spice, try somewhere else.	2
Food tasted good and everyone was very nice but was it coincidence that we were both glued to the toilet that night?  Might give it another try but need to give the flora a chance to rebuild in my gut first.	2
Meeh it is just ok.  But I have only ever been here for thier buffet breakfast between 1am and 3am after Pub Crawling downtown.  They manage to work with large crowds well and the food is typical of a hot breakfast buffet.  \n\nI can't speak for their regular menu items, but I do hear they offer a Happy Hour appetizer buffet that I may have to check out sometime.	2
this place is delicious!! my boyfriend ordered the yellow curry with rice while i had the pad see ew. my dish was very flavorful, just the way i like it. i tried my bf's dish and i was crying because i bit into a green chili pepper which i thought was a bell pepper!! i downed a whole glass of thai tea to washed the spiciness out. yikes* eat with caution you thai-food lovers!! the rice was kind of hard and not soft/chewy to my preference. the service was pretty slow for a place thats not so crowded, it was kind of pricey too.	2
I went here to get some service done. They did several things including change of my thermostat. I normally like Firestone and prefer to go to them. I was disappointed that they charged me a diagnostic fee and did not credit that fee towards my expensive repair.\n\nFast forward to a later date, my car overheats again. I take it to another Firestone, and they tell me (and show me) that the thermostat gasket was installed incorrectly.\n\nNo big harm, I don't think there was any engine damage.  Firestone in Glendale, Ca fixed the issue under warranty.	2
Went for dinner (all you can eat) last night. Wasn't super impressed with the variety of rolls. We ended up getting a couple that were nearly identical. Oops! \n\nBut - the poke was delicious and the 808 Special was my favorite. And all of the nigiri we ordered was pretty standard. \n\nI wouldn't bend over backwards to come here, but it's a reasonable option if you're in the area!	2
Food was good I have to admit.  But only issues I have is Why so long of a wait especially after 6:30 PM?  After my party was seated around 7 PM, I went to their big room by the bar area, And saw they had so much plenty of space left at least 30 seats available.  So not sure why they keep making people wait outside for so long, That's the reason why I gave it three stars.	2
Good food. We have had a lot of Indian food in Montreal and in the UK. This one is above average by international standard s. The service though is a bit disorganized and I would the belly dancer and the loud music for something more quaint. But overall worth repeat visits	2
food was good but we were the only people in there and the service was bad and took 20 mins to get our burgers to our table	2
Always clean, always fresh, or maybe my timing is always awesome. Also, they are very quick to get you through the line, even at lunch rush!	2
This review is for the Foundation room bar. Views are to die for - best on the strip. Go on a Monday night when it's free. Expect to pay $10 a drink minimum. Two out of 10 of us threw up immediately after drinking rum & cokes. No other explanation other than we were roofied. Buyer beware	2
I've always wanted to try this place out and I finally did on a Wednesday for brunch. Image atmosphere was very clean and cute. I had the Angus patty meal. It was alright. My friend had the waffles. He thought they were good. Service was friendly but I felt was kind of slow.. I overall rate this place as decent, it wouldn't be my first choice but I would return if I was to lazy to drive anywhere else because I live down the street. Haha	2
I absolutely love the pool at Mandalay Bay; it is the main thing that keeps me coming back. The last time I stayed here I stayed in the extra bedroom suite with two king sized beds in two separate rooms. It was perfect for our party and we had no complaints. We stayed away from the restaurants and ordered room service each night which was pretty standard but still good. \n\nThe staff was helpful and kind to us and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here although we tended to gravitate towards the other hotels on the strip for most of our stay.	2
Not the best place on the strip, but not the worst. Planet Hollywood's existence is the result of The Aladdin, having occupied the property before, doing a terrible job of making the 1001 Nights theme work (personally I don't know how one screws up one of the richest, most evocative and imagination capturing motifs ever, but there you go). That being said the casino is a bit dark and not so well plotted out. Also I am somewhat annoyed whenever Los Angeles (with its Hollywood theme) tries to impose itself on Las Vegas, but maybe that's just me. Still worth a look.	2
Fantastic Italian meal!  Service was perfect! The chicken parm was huge and perfectly cooked. The lasagna was also amazing.  Good wine list and some serious cocktails, although it's too bad they can't make a proper twist. Ruins it. Too full for the desert list but the petit fours offered with the check were quite good. Can't wait to come back!	3
The pros: the ambiance, the food, and the uniqueness of it all.\n\nThe setting is very relaxing and romantic. We had never had fondue before, and found it very entertaining. Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing.\n\nThe cons: the price and it can get pretty busy.\n\nI don't remember our exact total, but I do remember thinking \"holy crap\" when they brought the check. Also make sure to plan ahead. Show up without reservations and you'll end up waiting a while.\n\nOverall the experience was pleasant.	3
So it appears that the poor economy has effected the W. It seems you no longer have to be on the \"list\". The door guy is excepting $80 in cash for those willing to pay. Are you kidding me? The place is now over run with even more douchebags and boob jobs. \nHowever, I will continue to hang here despite the whole retarded scene. I like to watch the douchebags drool and the couches are comfy.	3
What can you say, you can't beat the $10 month to month membership.  It does not have everything you would find in a full service gym but for the cost it is an excellent value.  There are three things I wish they had but won't complain; steam room, sauna and a rower machine.  Like all gyms you will find free weights, weight machines, tons of cardio machines with TV's and iPod connectors.  You will always find a cardio machine during peak times but will not find any classes or daycare but again for the price no biggie.	3
Pros:\n\n-pretty decor\n-very clean \n-best sized portions for spring rolls that I've tried in the Phoenix area\n-Che Thai (dessert drink) is really tasty\n-Cafe Sua Da (Vietnamese coffee) is really strong and sweet, even a non-coffee-drinker like me liked it\n\n\nCons:\n\n-broth for pho was good, not SUPER flavorful but still a good meal\n-price is a bit higher than I would like, but not unreasonable\n\nI will definitely be back here and hope to try dishes other than the pho!	3
The dirty O\n\nGod, i used to head here after high school when I went shopping at Teleropa and just had to rebel from my ideal suburban parents.\n\nCheese fries... no, that isn't descriptive enough.  A WHOLE basket of deep dried goodness, covering the red plastic tray and falling to the floor as you searched for a table in this iconic grease ladden Pittsburgh hang out.	3
I was at The Pearl this last weekend to watch the UFC 115 Ultimate Fighter Finale. My boyfriend got us front row seats!!! But near the end of the fight.. I think it was Hamel and Jardine..his blood splattered all over me from the pit!!! It went all over my pink dress. HOW DISGUSTING!! And the stupid people chanting \"Let's Go Hamil, Let's Go!!\" How annoying. Grow up you high schoolers.\n\nNice venue...I'd like to see a concert there.	3
Great place to go as a family. Menu prices are a bit high, but you pay for your experience. Tina was our server and she was great. She was very attentive and provided great service. My husband and I ordered the beastly burger and shared it. I would definitely recommend sharing, the burger was huge!!! The burger was salty, but I myself enjoy things on the salty side so it was perfect. Overall, this is a great place to come for special family outings.	3
Simple American food, fairly well done. Pleasing atmosphere and friendly staff, reasonable prices.	3
Definitely worth a stop the next time you have to venture out Independence! Yummy feta, baklava, and a great assortment of lots of other foods, like olive oil, jam, and cookies. And the frozen section has a ton of drool-inducing stuff like spanakopita to bake at home - next time I have a party I will stop here for appetizers! The guy who was working there was very friendly and helpful. My only suggestion is that the pita bread be fresh or baked in-house instead of in refrigerated packs. (Though it was still pretty tasty after a few minutes in the toaster oven!)	3
Much nicer hotel than the price would indicate...definitely recommend it if you are going to stay off the strip.  The staff in the hotel, spa and casino were all incredibly helplful.	3
pizza pizza!  I have never dined here, but have picked up pizza numerous times.  I like it a lot.  It's better than most other pizza and it's really close to my house.\n\nBelfiore has a restaurant on one side and a deli/bakery on the other,  the cannolis are really good too.  I have not tried the other treats but I plan to sometime soon ( as soon as I forget my new years resolution).	3
This is a really nice, clean, smoke-free hotel in City Center.  It doesn't have the flash of Aria or the Cosmopolitan, but it is a really nice option for that part of the Strip. All of the people that worked there were super friendly as well. Our room was really spacious and had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  One complaint would be that the in-room refrigerator only kept our food cool not cold.  Also, while the pool is really nice, it is not the scene that you may be seeking while in Las Vegas.  The Starbucks in the lobby is also an added bonus.	3
They have lost a a star as my most recent visit shows that they have changed chefs a couple of times...	3
Good for being in Pittsburgh, but it didn't knock it out of the park. Tasty, but not amazing.	3
I was wonderfully surprised at this awesome little shop. This shop carried unique items and wicked awesome prices.	3
Have you ever been mad at a restaurant because it's so good? Well, this is where I'm at with Pei Wei. I generally abhor all chain restaurants and prefer to go the road less traveled when it comes to eating out. However, due to my love for Pei Wei I never get to try any new Asian places. Yea sure, I think about it. I want to, but I just can't.  \n\nSo in closing: Pei Wei I love you like an old comfortable sweater. And I hate you because that sweater never did look that great on me.	4
Let me first off say my car is about 4-5 from the ground so it's pretty low.\nAnd my Rims are 18x9.5 so they are stretched!!! \n\nThis is my first time here and I've been to many car wash, but this one beats then all. From me arriving until I left the lot. The works to the facility were great. I couldn't be more happy. \n\nThey were working on my car for 30 mins!! Good car wash takes time!!! \n\nI would come here every time from now on.	4
Love it.  Amazing food in an amazing atmospere at an amazing location.  What more could you ask for?	4
Even though I barely come to Vegas now, if I ever visit, I will definitely come here. Their calamari was delicious nice and crispy, so good. I loved the chicken marsala too. Everything about it was just perfect. The dessert here was unbelievable. Other desserts at chain Italian restaurants like Pasta Pomodoro and Macaroni and Grill are ok but these were awesome. The oreo ice cream was really unique and tiramisu, I could've just eaten a million slices of it. If you're visiting Vegas anytime soon, this is must to eat here.	4
I cant say enough about how cool this place is...I always call ahead for my lunch break and they always mange to throw in some kinda complimentary chips or tea..just makes you feel so welcomed and appreciated. The owner is very nice (and cute) and he always greets you with a smile. Kudos yall;)	4
The best steakhouse in vegas bar none. The best secret in vegas for us locals as well. You would never know it, food this good in a station casino??? what??? Yep. The ribeye is insane, I normally am a filet guy but the ribeye here surpasses ANY piece of beef I have ever had anywhere. I can't really say much else...	4
See all the legends on one night! Had a fab time. Good value for money and a very moving finish. The host is amazing!!!	4
My Girlfriends and I met for Breakfast.  The  restaurant was clean and it appeared to be busy. The food was delicious and the service was great.  I would highly recommend to friends and family.  Thanks Carol!	4
Very helpful.  Barista took the time to explain perks that will keep us coming back! Thanks Hillary!	4
Omg. This place is the best. The milkshakes will cure any bad day. And  the staff is always very nice! I'm a regular....	4
I don't even know where to begin. Ive never had a bad sandwich. Tried many different ones. My favorite one is the kgb. It's amazing. Try the purple haze beer. The home made rice crispy treats. Oh my God and the drink selection.. they have TANG ON TAP!  LOVE THIS PLACE!	4
I wanted to say how happy I am that I contacted Dolcinea! I have had lashes put on since last November at Cherry Lash Lounge (over-priced) and left after many attempts disappointed. I wasn't happy with the fullness of my lashes.\nI called Dolcinea at Humble Bee to see what could be done. She did an amazing job! They are so much FULLER and feel lighter. I have so many more lashes and got compliments from someone immediately after leaving Sola Salon! Love my lashes now! Prices are very reasonable! Check her out - she is worth it.\nShe is awesome!!	4
Very great place for one of the best day of your life. Everything was perfect. Thanks for the people who work there, continue on this way!	4
I could eat a whole vat of their SAMBAR. And my boyfriend says every time he's eating something, he thinks, I'm going to get more of this. There is no end to the deliciousness of this place!	4
I've enjoyed my trip to  Phoenix and the good food is one of the reasons.  I really liked Ristorante Giuseppe.  Great food and the owner was very welcoming.  Plus BYOB.  Yes, not the fanciest place, but felt like you were dining someplace special.  I would go back in a heartbeat.	4
I had a wonderful first visit to Skin Oasis over the Christmas Holiday! The staff was super friendly and answered all my questions I had regarding my treatments. Teeth whitening was painless and my teeth look so much better. I had my first laser hair treatments as well, which I highly recommend! They also do b-12 shots for a quick energy boost and flu shots. Both were painless.  I am looking forward to my next visit!! :)	4
Nice to have close by but no customer service	1
My mom and I decided to go to Arcadia farms fir early mothers day lunch and were sadly disappointed our waitress never asked if we needed anything to drink other then water she never asked if we needed anything at all she just sat our food down and walked away that is when it finally came. She just wasn't welcoming and the food was not great	1
Pretty plain, nice presentation but lacks every place else.	1
Expensive	1
It would have been good if I had children attending but I did not. It was date night and did not think it was funny at all. Wanted to leave at intermission but did not want to be rude. The audience was full of kids and street dressed. I was disappointed since we don't get out much, I would not attend again. Might be good for group of kids - like a birthday party?	1
I've tried the breakfast sandwiches a couple of times and wasn't too impressed either time.  Seems like glorified fast food and I would much rather have McDonalds since I get what I expect for a more reasonable price.	1
I wasn't impressed with the food or service.  Whats worse, I'm thinking they over charged us for our so called \"starter\" that came out about half way through our meal.  The food wasn't bad, but for 10.00 I'm thinking my burger should not have been as anorexic as it was.  The bread pudding I had for dessert was nothing to write home about as it just didn't taste like bread pudding should.	1
Great food and drinks but when having a Martin they fill the glass about half full. Order wine and still poured short compared to other locations. Charging that much for a drink should at least get what other locations server	1
Worst experience tonight. Did not listen when the young man was working there to take my order. I asked for more than heard. Also he forgot another mans order, that was there 4 people before me( he got his money back) then he gave me my food with no bag and gave me my hot sauce in my hand. I asked for a bag and he said that they were to small for my food.. WTF..	1
This place started off great but I believe the main chef left and now nothing comes out as ordered.	1
I have an appreciation for nice things and high quality merchandise. Sadly like many other \"big name\" brands everything looks like everything and everyone else....That is unless the logo or the branding is marked all over the entire thing. Who cares what purse, wallet, scarf, etc you have.....Unless you want the world to know how much money you spend on something....	1
My buddy wanted a beer and some eye candy.  I wanted some water and Sportscenter.  This place fit the bill for both.\n\nWhat it didn't fit the bill for?  Service, friendliness, and decor.\n\nTacky, lame, and stuck up waitresses that were no more attractive than the waitresses anywhere else.....thanks but no thanks.  \n\nThere are better sports bars in almost every American city and I don't give a damn if your servers are in bikinis or not, bad service is bad service.	1
Been there a couple times since it got converted over from Tangerine.  It looks the same layout to me.  Decent balcony, but that's about it.  Pass.	1
My meaty potato(brisket) was excellent. Service is slow and not good. Drinks are soda, beer and  black tea. Not having one hydrating drink in AZ is ridiculous. GF's chicken was too salty, her kiddo loved the pulled pork potato. Air conditioning woefully inadequate!	1
Great food,  breathtaking views.  Awful awful service.  I go there frequently an the last two times we have waited twenty minutes for initial greetings, 45 minutes for drinks and an hour for food.  If they fix this I will re rate.  Otherwise,  I will be staying a way for a bit.	1
Low quality food, I've had salads and their burgers, while not being terrible, it's not good.  Typical strip prices (relatively high) and quality comparable to a cheap grocery store deli.	1
This Starbucks has a huge sign stating it now serves breakfast. After waiting in line for 10 minutes on 2 occasions, I was told \"the delivery didn't arrive\". They simply advertise something they never have.....	0
