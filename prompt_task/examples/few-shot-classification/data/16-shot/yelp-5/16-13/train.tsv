Are you serious?  What are you doing?  If you've given up, if you've just said \"$&@! It, let's just get panda\", or you've got a gaggle of screaming kids that won't shut their mouths unless you immediately fill them with orange chicken, then go ahead.  But if you have a choice, and a working brain, go to one of the dozens of local chinese places in the area.  I recommend China Tango.	1
Ordered some food.. the alfredo chicken was terrible.  I had to dump my entire chili flakes for the flavor... when they cooked the brocolli they dragged the excess water in the pasta dish...  or it was frozen and melted with the cooking process... either way that particular dish tasted bland\n...  I've worked in the service industry for over 20 years.....  and can tell what's freshly made.  The delivery was cool.. tipped him fat but maybe I'll try and get something else if I order from here again.	1
So we ate here for our last breakfast before we left. Tuesday morning, we caught the end of breakfast, and then got lunch. The food was mediocre, but for the price wasn't too bad. $21.99 for adults. They had the basics pizza, meat, mash potatoes, fruit, Asian, Mexican, etc. Not a lot of choices for the vegetarian, at least I didn't think so. And many varieties of dessert, all you can drink is extra, we didn't opt for it. This was fine cause we were their, but over all we won't be back.	1
Food itself is still great, but these new owners don't understand the importance of Cholula. We came here a few weeks ago and they were out of Cholula and only had Tobasco (yuck), now they are out of both. C'mon, get it together!  The Tempe location always has plenty.	1
This was the worst experience we've ever had at this Red Robbin. Our food didn't make It to the table for almost 50 minutes. Then the waitress, had a very unwelcoming attitude when we asked for more fries, as I we were bothering her. It'll be a long time before we come back to this place, and that's too bad, because I love it here.	1
My go-to place for boba...until today. This was the second time they didn't add boba after I asked for it (which I though was the default choice). I'll be looking for someplace closer to home from now on.	1
I do not like their pizza, it was soggy, undercooked and really not good at all, oh and the salad was gross (how you mess that up is beyond me)\nI am a thin crust NY style pizza fan, and this was nothing like that, \nnot for me!	1
I know it is lunch time and I know it is in Oakland, but they only had one person in the kitchen. One person! Our food took 45 minutes to come for a chicken wrap. Not very impressive at all.  The upside, the staff was apologetic and very friendly. I would go back to try it maybe not during the lunch rush, or if they had more people cooking in the back. 45 minutes is too long to wait!	1
Atmosphere: very upscale, clubby, boutiquey similar to W Hotels.\n\nService: Accommodating and professional\n\nFood: GROSS! Shirmp tempura might as well have been a corn dog. Lobster tail  was disgusting. It wasn't lobster - it was lobster flavored fish. It is insulting the iintelligence of the guests to serve this as lobster. \n\nScene: After dinner, all the tables become bottle service tables without seating. Pretty people dancing around their tables and girls running around and flirting to get free drinks. It was funny and a little pathetic but I was with married friends so they welcomed the attention.	1
I went to this location earlier today and was disappointed in this store. I didn't shop the whole store, because the place was very disorganized. The records weren't alphabetized correctly, and they weren't organized at all. There were a few records that I considered buying, but after seeing how bad this disorganized this place was, and how there were about four or five people hanging out behind the counter I decided to put my selections back. If you can't take the time to organize your records, or even know how to bin them correctly, then I have no time for you.	1
I have a friend who insists we eat here when we get together. Sometimes he wins, sometimes I do. \n\nArby's reminds me of the Roy Roger's chain, which I believe they bought a few decades ago, but without the cowboy stuff. The food is not bad now that they have updated their menus. \n\nBut the old beef sandwiches which I do not believe either Geno's nor Pat's would serve in Philly is still on the menu. Ugh. \n\nSomethings do take a while to die I guess. I also need to get new friends. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give them two stars for the new menu.	1
Didn't see too much in particular that I loved about this place. It is very small, and is truly a \"grab and go\" kind of place amongst the shops in Uptown. Considering all of the other coffee shops in the area you can find, I would probably skip here and go somewhere else.	1
Hot dogs, fries, etc are good. Most of the staff just stands around even when a line is forming. Eventually someone takes the order, but often times they don't place the order and the food isn't made. Two people in our group waited 20-30 minutes and no food ever came out. After complaining, they made some excuses and refunded their money. This place needs better management and/or staff.	1
I was truly not impressed with this place. We went there because my husband and daughter said it was good. I ordered the pork carnitas tacos. Son and hubby ordered the ribeye steak tacos and my daughter ordered the tostada paquime   When they say these are street tacos they mean it. Very small with outrageous pricing and not that good of food. If you want small portions that cost alot then this is your place.	1
They have great chicken tenders that always taste freshly made. BUT if you go thru the Drive-Thru, always check your order before you leave. The last three times I ordered the 5 piece chicken tenders, my order only had 3. So either somebody doesn't know how to count in there, or it's done deliberately. Whatever the reason, it's absolutely annoying and inconvenient to have to park and walk in just to get the two missing pieces.	1
I had a great time. I took a magazine and newspaper and just hung out for a while. The food and coffee was great! I had this great Asian Wrap. I even took a sandwich to go for my partner! (which he loved). I'm on my way back there right now to try out breakfast. This is a great little neighborhood cafe	3
This place is HOT! Soooo crowded during the dinner rush hours. The Salt & Pepper Squid was out of this wold. If you have a large group probably better to have a late dinner here. I definitely recommend this restaurant especially if you like being around a lot of hot people.	3
When I drive to Las Vegas  I make it a point to  visit a TJ for wine that's not sold in CA. It's crazy BC  the win is bottled in Duarte CA! \n\nThis TJ has ample parking and check out was a breeze. I ended up stocking up on a entire case of wine.\n\nI'm ready for holidays.	3
This is very good BBQ; not the best I've had, but certainly one of the best.  The service was quick and friendly (you order at the counter).  Prices are about typical.  The \"restaurant\" is a simple arrangement in an industrial complex.  Don't expect ambiance here, it's just a place to eat really good BBQ.\n\nThey have a good assortment of tasty BBQ sauces at each table.  Try them all!	3
Retro-Fabulous. This was my second stay at the Valley Ho in the past year. I'm very satisfied with the large rooms, nice patios, good menu and lovely spa products (Iclandic Moon Flower!). \n\nI also thought the service was great. I love that they've managed to transform the ultra dated architecture into a hip place with throw-back charm.	3
Came in on our way to the airport to get some deep fried chicken skin and my gf couldn't resist trying their halo halo. She liked the halo halo, chicken skin not so much.\n\nPlace was pretty busy and the food looked good, maybe next trip we'll try it out.	3
Abay is the perfect example of my claim that surprising, Pittsburgh has really good ethnic foods! If you've never had Ethiopian food and you enjoy immersing yourself in culinary exploration, Abay is a great place to pop your Ethiopian cherry. That is if Marcus Samuelsson doesn't get to you first.\n\nKeep it up, Abay and Pittsburgh! I miss you. \n\n------------------------------\n\nOn a personal note, writing reviews for Pittsburgh makes me nostalgic of my wonderful times there. Since leaving that city, I've lost at least 5 pounds.	3
I have traveled to the Phoenix area twice in the last couple of years and made it to Frank and Lupe's each time.  During my first visit, someone at a local jewelry store recommended this restaurant to me and decided to give it a go. \n\nThe food was delicious and the service was prompt.  The fajitas were really good and the salsa was addicting.	3
We were all kind of surprised at the ratings for this place, but this place was good! I just found it silly that everyone working there had to wear grass skirts haha. \n\nThey took a picture of us and told us it'll be on a postcard. Okay sure...by the end of our meal, we got a few free photos for souvenir. Cool! But we didn't want to pay for the big version of the photo haha. \n\nI shared a Kalua Pig Sandwich, and that was very satisfying and delicious. Everything else that my party ordered was good as well! No complaints! A little bit on the pricey side, but that's Vegas for you.	3
Love getting my nails done here. They always have an opening and the place is so much cleaner then the other places I've tried.	3
One of the best indian food preparations in Phoenix/Tempe area	3
SanTan is always a good bet for late night food and a wonderful atmosphere.  I love the brewery set up, though I've never been a beer drinker.  Their limited cocktail selections have always been delicious.\n\nFor food, I recommend the Devil's Chicken Fingers or the San Tan Bangers and Mash.  Both are favorites.  They also have a special of the day that has rarely missed the mark.  \n\nMake sure you check them out on one of the less busy nights (no live music) to be sure you have that real home-town feeling that they have.  I like the service and the atmosphere.	3
The food was great at Cowfish - I had a combo box with a Vegetarian roll and a mini burger. The burger was delicious, cooked just right. The vegetarian roll had a mixture of asparagus, cucumber and avocado. We didn't have a reservation for a Friday night, but we only had to wait about 40 minutes to get a table for 6 which was nice. The 1 downfall is that they didn't have a tumpura sweet potato roll - which I crave when I am out for sushi!! I definitely recommend this place if you're in the Charlotte area!!	3
Went shooting w/ my son on 7/5/12/  A little out of the way for me as I live in Mesa, but a very nice overall experience. Front end is small and inventory to match, but the range is air conditioned, as opposed to swamp cooled like the other E. valley place.That alone will make it my place to shoot in the summer months. Staff was very friendly Good overall experience.  Haven't used sales or gunsmith yet.	3
Love the place.  The service is fantastic and fast. There is truth in the other reviews about portion size being small for the amount paid, but the food is delicious	3
possibly the best gyro I've ever had. Tabouli was great. And you need to try the saffron ice cream. Hummus was a	3
A-OK quick pizza! Fast casual restaurant where you can add toppings and they cook the personal pizza right there.	2
Like the place; definite dive bar, but breakfast and service are very good. Interesting atmosphere on sat/sun mornings for porn in the morn....you really get desensitized to the porn after the third time or so that you attend one of those events. A lot of hardcore gambling machine players too if you're into that sort of thing.... The machines get a lot of mileage.\n\nOnly thing I don't like about this place is the bathrooms...they don't necessarily smell awful but you can smell \"old, but cleanish bathroom\" scent in roughly a quarter of the bar. ventilation in those bathrooms needs to be redone.	2
Clean, easy to navigate, and uncrowded.  However, you should plan on LOTS of walking when switching terminals!	2
Good coffee and toasted bagel.	2
i actually liked this buffet. probably because they were also handing out coupons on the strip. the quality of the food was decent compared to other buffets in vegas. however, i can't remember anything spectaular. you wait in line upstairs and when they allow you to go downstairs there is another line.	2
The hotel and rooms are pretty nice for what you're paying. They even have a bowling alley and movie theater here. I also enjoy coming here for the $5 blackjack! WOOO!\n\nBUT sadly, i've never won anything from here before! My friends and I ALWAYS lose our money in this place! Something about this place always makes us throw our money into the casino's pockets. \n\nAlso, the poker table is filled with locals, so unless you really know how to play, I suggest you don't come here. Plus, these locals can be a bit snobby toward tourists.	2
I love to get into Ranch Market every now and then for something different. It is an enjoyable afternoon to stroll in have lunch and and agua fresca! I got some Carne Asada and we actually didn't care for it, the marinade sucked and we will visit our local carnecia for now on.. I also noticed that my produce went bad fast that was purchased that day!	2
They don't take cards, which is a bummer.\n\nWhat I don't like is that it can be a hotspot for teens to socialize (since there's a high school basically across the street); which can get rowdy and annoying.	2
Went here a bit late in the day on a Sunday, and was disappointed that they had run out of a lot of the empanadas that I had wanted to try. The hot sauce was a highlight (lots of corriander). Good price, though I wasn't blown away. The ones I took home heated up reasonably well the next day for a second meal. \n\n Will probably try again another time, but next time earlier in the day.	2
Meh. You never know what to expect from the portions based on the descriptions. The sushi wasn't the best I've had, not bad, but nothing worth commanding such a high dollar. The music in the dining area is so loud you cannot hear the people you're dining with. Upstairs is supposed to be the club, hello. Yes. the club is packed. You're a sardine. Packed.	2
Stopped in Yogurtology & thought the choices of flavors were pretty good. The toppings bar was good - lots of fresh fruit, cereal, chocolate & candy. Maybe a little too cramped, though, since I felt like I spilled everything I grabbed. \n\nIt was about $10 for 2 of us & we got a loyalty card. No idea what the loyalty card gets you (no one explained, just asked if we wanted one) but we have one & we will be using it when we stop back in!	2
The cost model is very good.  Middling quality sushi but no plate is priced over $2.  So honestly, for my budget, I'd eat here more often b/c it is good for a quick cheap sushi fix than if it was pricey for good quality sushi.\n\nThe only standouts -- eel and this other plate of krab w/ tuna slice wrapped around it w/ avacado on it.\n\nI wouldn't take a die hard sushi fan here, but I would take someone who doesn't eat sushi much so wouldn't care anyhow and would enjoy the conveyer belt concept.	2
Back in the day, this was the place to go and have a real quality \"Vegas style\" buffet , great food and low prices. The food is still pretty good, but the  Sunday buffet I used to enjoy while having  maintained the same quality  food, has tripled  the price, even with the locals players card discountThe last few trips have proven to disapoint, as the normally friendly greeters and servers have taken on a serious case of I dont care. Three stars	2
Just wrote a tip.  The food is great.  Service not so much.    Couldn't get ice tea refill.  Time to stop and take care of tables. :/	2
What has two thumbs and goes to a sandwich place for its pickles?  This guy... I used to love coming here and rockin' the pickle bar while waiting on my sandwich... it seemed like such a novelty.  Anyway, it's a good place.  I like that you can grab beer here too.  The upstairs is fun sometimes.\n\nSandwiches are yummy, though a bit overpriced.  I think the selection is awesome and the ingredients are solid.	2
Nice quite rooms and a good location for getting around. Kind of showing it's age though.  Great price!	2
I have made 5 calls - left three messages. No response and no one was able to help me until i demanded a manager.	0
What happened to The Raven Grill?!  Dining rooms half full early Sunday evening and all as-yet-unseated guests were directed by a manager to wait outside because they were \"out of menus\".  Once seated (one of three parties in the entire room) we apparently were invisible to the only waiter working the room. After just over 15 minutes of being completely ignored we simply left, but not before overhearing the phantom waiter tell a neighboring table he couldn't serve their drinks as ordered because \"the blender broke this weekend\". Verrado is too far a drive to risk another dining disaster -- we won't be back.	0
This place has put the meaning of wait into waitstaff.	0
Sorry folks, but this place needs a major renovation. It could be a cool '50s-type restaurant if they would spend a little money to clean it up. The food is greasy, and some of the waitresses are sporting tattoos and multiple piercings - a major turnoff for the food industry in my opinion. Try Big House Cafe down the street if you want a good breakfast at a good price in a clean environment. Pass this one by.	0
Called and placed my order. Was told told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived 10 mins after I called and waited 20 more mins. People came in  after me were seated and got there food. When I finally received my food and took it home it was cold. Never going here again. And not to mention the friend wonton was fried so hard I could barely eat and. And nothing was inside of them .	0
If I could give zero stars I would. This show was terrible. I would have rather put the money I spent on the tickets into a hopeless slot machine. Superstars were unrealistic, and did not look like real singers. Overall, this show was a bust.	0
Found a rusted metal thread in my burritto...supposedly from the grill cleaning brush per the waitress. They didn't charge me for it...however I ain't going back!! Beware - check your food!!	0
These guys are clearly uneducated and mix currency's by different countries in different continents! They didn't know how to exchange currency, when I always do it at different chains. I don't recommend this place there's one down the road that must be better..	0
Doesn't this place know the medical office is only as good as it's front office. How can you charge someone a $ 40 copay if the insurance plan doesn't have a copay even though you accept the insurance plan. That's fraud, waste and abuse.	0
Rude staff with horrible management! Not returning for a loooooooong time! The cashier had no manners, continually messing up. Then she had to have a sweet manager come to help. That was fine. But once the manager left, another rude amber came in with an attitude. This did nothing to help fix the problem. Won't be returning.	0
I have also never been inside Kam's, and that is causally related to the reason I can still give it one star:  I have to walk by its vomit stench lined exterior every fucking day during school to get to the psych building, and on unofficial I have to endure having riot police stationed in the lobby of my building to prevent the kam vomit and mayhem flow from infiltrating the psychology building.  \n\nThe vomit smell is even there at like 8AM on Tuesday mornings!  When I was in college, I went to bars that didn't card too, but on the real I still don't understand why anyone would go to kam's.	0
This place was horrible. The room had 2 beds however it was not quite a twin or full. I never seen beds so small. The was no hairdryer, coffee maker, etc. I'm surprised it has running water. The pool was not all that great either. They need to clean the tank so u can see the fish better. Overall, I would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone I know.	0
Went here with my wife hoping for a nice cool treat, I got the Diablito wich has chamoy, chili, tamarind and lime, my wife got the strawberry and cream. These were absolutely the worst tasting things we have ever tried. Mine was bitter and sour and not at all appetizing. My wife's strawberry and cream tasted rancid like either the cream went bad or the strawberry a did. We had to throw then away after just a few bites, an unfortunate waste of money.	0
The place is nice as it is decorated with interesting fish in fish tanks all over the place. The service here is horrible. The waitresses are rude. The food is nothing special and super expensive. Do not recommend, especially if you have kids that hate waiting 30+ min for their food:/	0
Terrible shuttle service. When you come out of the terminal, you can't see the sign telling you where to stand - it's 3 feet off the ground and surrounded by the crowd of waiting people. Then there aren't enough busses. No where near ... We waited over 30 min for a bus. There's no organization, no one directing drivers or people. Weakest shuttle I've experienced.  A shame. Avoid.	0
I'm surprised at how many people like this place.  Ordered food from them and after only a few bites me and my hubby where extremely disappointed and bummed out that we had spent money on this place. Our dogs however where very happy to get a special treat.  Guess it is back to the drawing board on a good Chinese place that delivers.	0
Wah Wah Wah, everyone's a food critic nowadays. Whatever, I think the food is good and if I don't like it, I simply won't return. Why waste your time telling the whole world that your beans were slightly warm or that the cheese wasn't totally melted the way you like. I think people should make their own meals at home if they think they deserve perfection.	4
I have also been eating Falbo Bros pizza since college. I considered it the best pizza in Madison then and it is still the best pizza in Madison now. Great sausage. Lots of cheese. Good sauce. Great crust. This is some of the best pizza I've ever had and I've had it well over one hundred times. Go eat this pizza now.	4
I tried this place out because of a groupon deal and loved the varied classes and the warm instructors. Non-judgmental and friendly atmosphere.	4
First of all, Scottsdale, AZ is BEAUTIFUL. If you're thinking of coming to Arizona, visit this city and take a peek at this hotel! Check in on foursquare at the hotel bar and receive a free CD. Make sure to check out the gondola boat rides for a fun and unique experience. Don't miss \"Wine Me, Dine Me\" at SWB. Lobo Fitness is one of the best hotel gyms I have seen. Spend an afternoon/evening sitting out by the pool for a relaxing and satisfying end to the day. Don't forget to enjoy the fantastic hotel restaurants!	4
Incredible burger at such a reasonable price!	4
Adult computer classes, children's programing, movies, CD's, books!   Free.  What's not to like.  Staff is helpful and usually a pretty quite place.  They do sometimes have programs that spill out into library but have to love the community participating so a little noise isn't going to hurt anyone.	4
These guys are amazing! Been having problems with my A/C on and off. Had Mast come out and after inspection, recommended to my home warranty company that my entire unit be replaced (it was at least 20 yrs old!). Needless to say they came back and did such a fantastic job with everything, I couldn't be more pleased!! They even called the next day to make sure my unit was running to satisfaction. The best A/C company in AZ!!\nps- this was in August, on a very hot day and I am one very happy customer! Sorry for the late review!	4
Really good food and really good service. I got bibim noodles and the patty was delicious. My dad liked the seafood stone rice bowl. My mom had some fried chicken dish which was pretty good too.	4
Been hearing about this place for couple months. My place to go is usually any of your top chains. I walked in and was greeted promptly and friendly. Easy menu after I got the hang of it. And the owner is really from New York a us for me as I am too. I am super picky with cleanliness and this place is clean. Came home and started eating and man am I in New York heaven. I love it. Omg I can't wait to go back and take all my family and friends.	4
Completely worth the wait. Great food, great service and you will leave full.\n\nEverything on the menu is delicious.	4
Food is amazing they have the best BBQ pork and BBQ pork fried rice I've ever had in Las Vegas!!!! I also tried the pot stickers and orange chicken!! All  I highly recommend this restaurant to all who enjoy great service and a relaxing dining atmosphere!	4
Our return here was because of the Chicken Hainan with rice and the options of dark/white, bone in or out. It's simple, but tasty. The salt/pepper chicken wings is also another favorite of ours. We tried the Congee for the first time with boneless fish & pork with preserved egg and liked it. I still wish we had room for another favorite of ours, the chicken curry with Roti......yummy. This place is friendly, excellent value, fast, and satisfying.	4
If you're looking for a great stylist, book an appointment with Heather Galwey. She does great color too. My hair never looked better.	4
Have been going there for a couple of months now. Haven't had a bad taco yet. It's the way food should be . No need to add anything to it, just eat it straight from the kitchen. Love the shanghai tacos. the staff is great and very friendly. Have taken several friends and and all have love it. Can't wait to go back.\nCAUTION!!!!! it's addicting.	4
GIGANTIC menu! Everything I have tried here was tasty. A great place to go in a group, order a few dishes and share. We have had several parties here and everybody has loved it.\n\nIt is also BYOB, another plus for parties.	4
Last night was girls night (Thirsty Thursday is what I like to call it ;) & we decided to try this place. We had the BEST time. The cocktails were delicious, the food was scrumptious & the service was phenomenal. Our waiter was awesome. He was funny & attentive. It felt like he had been our friend for years. We found out half way through our meal that our waiter was actually the owner. Last night was such a great experience. I'm so glad we gave it a try.	4
Nothing special.  Icing is heavy and there is too much on each cupcake.  The flavor in the chocolate cupcake was good though.  Better than Sprinkles.	1
