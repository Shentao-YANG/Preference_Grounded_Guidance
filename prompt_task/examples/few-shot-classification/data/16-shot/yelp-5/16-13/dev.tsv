I would have to agree with previous reviews in that it's a unique and fun store, but I too have been treated very rudely by employees.  Not only do they sometimes look at you and not say hello, but when you go to purchase something they barely acknowledge you then too.  I've gone back to give them various chances, but they are not exactly warm or inviting unless you are a 50 year old, upper class woman doing some damage.  It's rather unfortunate.	1
I've eaten here a few times just hoping to get something amazing since it has such awesome reviews and it's always busy. The food is good but not great. The service is ok, not great.	1
blush is a cool place to hang out.. idk if it's a lounge. felt like it.. but with a club crowd? there's not enough places to chill and a million ppl walking around and around each other..   music was very typical vegas which isn't a favorite of mine but i deal.. and overall.. drinks f*'d me up... so maybe paying the price is worth it?   idk.. it's real pretty inside though..	1
I used I love coming here because it was convenient and never too crowded but lately I have been noticing the filth around and on the equipment. I have been here 3 days in a row this week and the same dust bunnies keep getting larger and larger. The layer of dirt, yes I said dirt, is disgusting. The machines are sticky and the area where I used to stretch has layers of filth in the corners.	1
I used to love it here. For years it was the best burger in town. But, I have to say the last couple times we've been here I've been really disappointed. The burger is BLAND now. I have to take this place off the list, too bad. Houston's/Hillstone burger has never disappointed, so we'll be going there from now on.	1
Great food but you probably don't want to go there for a lunch break they take forever, they messed up my order and took even longer.	1
Good food but terrible service. We've visited this restaurant three times this winter and each time it's the same lousy service and (last night) a very unhelpful waitress. Maybe we've just had bad luck at this place because so many people speak positively about both the food and service. Go figure.	1
I will not lie the food I have tried from here super yummy... but paying 7 to 10 bucks for a meal .. I WANT A MEAL... not a kids meal...	1
Old furniture, barely working faucets, and got charged $20 per day resort fee without any additional services. Even newspaper that part of the resort fee was never delivered.	1
So disappointed tonight about Venti.  Appetizers were cold and the pulp salad was not as good as it was last time we were there.  The waiter told us the chef they had since the beginning is gone to another restaurant .... Very sad, but the new one needs to go back to culinary school .... He has a lot to learn!	1
We were really disappointed in this place.  \n\nI made a rez for the first night my girls and I were in town. The service was spotty and the sushi was meh.  \n\nThat's all I really have or want to say.  Pass and go somewhere else.  Especially if you're looking for good sushi - find another spot.	1
The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a \"night out\" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.\n\nTwo stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers.	1
Not the best, probably won't go back and I go to town square all the time.  I do agree with the burnt crust comments, I have had coal fired pizza that was crispy but they didn't have to burn it to get it.  I don't really remember more about it because it really wasn't memorable.  Try Ciao Ciao, Grimaldi's, or settabello instead.	1
Very watery Korma. The Naan had the texture of baked pizza dough. The only good thing was the tartness of the mango lassie. They were the previous owners of Samosa Factory,  but their food didn't seem to carry over. Samosa Factory has surpassed this place greatly.	1
we went yesterday, Friday to check it out. #1 they moved down the street, no sign on the previous address to inform customers. Went to new address. Lady behind the counter never acknowledged our presents. Never said a word to us, I really don't think she even looked at us. I thought the items were ordinary and over priced. I found a sun dress that I own on one of the racks and it was priced $5.00 more than I bought it new.To me not worth a second look.	1
Family style atmosphere. Food was delicious. Owner talked to us and made suggestions based on our palate. He actually took the time to listen. Coolest thing I saw was when the couple at the other table had finished and were getting ready to discard half their food, he kind of took offense as he stated \"I hate to waste food\" and  turned their remaining food into sandwiches and sides to take home at no additional charge. I thought that was very cool. This place is what small businesses should be all about. Great food. Will definitely return. Even gave us tips on where to get excellent Mediterranean groceries!	3
I was looking for a good, mediterranean neighborhood grill, and this place fit the bill.  Although a little overpriced if you're getting non-wrap entrees, the food was delicious and well worth it.  The hummus was really tasty and fresh - a very large serving that could feed (as an appetizer) a packed table of people.  I had the falafel wrap and thought it was near-perfect.  Not dry (like most falafel), and just a wonderful blend of flavors.  My boyfriend had the chicken wrap and didn't love the marinade, but otherwise agreed that it's a great spot.	3
This place is great. I've been here plenty of times since the first one opened in Vegas. I really enjoy the Yakisoba. I usually get a chicken Yakisoba with a side of spicy chicken. Really good food for a fair price.	3
Pho is good here as it should be, hence the name. The broth had really good flavor and wasn't overly salty nor oily. The veggies that accompanied it was fresh and crisp. This place is extremely clean. I really like the disposable chopsticks and sauce cups at each table. Rice plates are okay - I prefer the place across for rice plates. \n\nVery good service. The owner was charming and pleasant. Price was a couple bucks more than the average pho joint but nothing outrageous.	3
Un club int\u00e9ressant le vendredi et le samedi pour ses soir\u00e9es ann\u00e9es 80 et ann\u00e9es 90. Toujours agr\u00e9able d'entendre \u00ab What Is Love ? \u00bb d'Haddaway ou \u00ab Blue Monday \u00bb de New Order, et autres classiques qu'on n'entend presque plus.	3
I like it here. It's a nice, open restaurant, clean bathrooms, and the food was cooked well and as I ordered. What else can you ask for in a fast food place?	3
I just love these restaurants. Great food and atmosphere . Service can be a bit lacking but that's kinda the vibe here-laid back.\nJust had another pasty tonight-oh so good: bangers and mash	3
Have been going here for years and usually eat here at least once a month. \n\nThe airplane views are great and the food is above average. There is a good reason its packed for b-fast and lunch, and thats because everyone likes it here! \n\nGive it a try for yourself and see! Oh yea, the french dip is great as are the Greek foods!	3
I don't care if it's all tourists here, there's something nice about eating poutine on the cobblestoned streets of Old Montreal. It doesn't make the poutine any less tasty: crisp fries, great gravy, and generous portions overall. You can definitely split one order between two people (if hungry) or three (if you're not greedy).\n\nThe beers are also a decent price, and there is ice cream - though we ended up going down the street to the maple store for dessert.	3
In a buffet town Todai is the class of the class. Yes it is all you can eat sushi. No they don't complain if you don't eat your rice. They have sushi, tempura, edamame, sashimi, miso soup, pot stickers and more. This doesn't even touch on the fruit or dessert bar. Make your own crepe anyone???\n\nAnd that is just lunch. During dinner they up the ante with crab legs and peeled shrimp.\n\nJust remember to grab the $5 coupon out of the taxi cab guide.\n\nThis is a Vegas must for me.	3
This place is great!  We have consistently had fresh, delicious fish meals there.  The fried shrimp taco is my favorite, along with their clam chowder.  They will occasionally have Seafood Soup, which is amazing.  And of course their fish-and-chips is great, although they seem to have changed it a bit in our most recent visits and it's a little smaller and less tasty.  My husband's \"go-to\" meal there is the salmon (always delicious) with vegetables.  Paired with a good selection of beers and it's a great meal.  Looking forward to sitting outside in cooler weather.	3
So fantastic! The salsa bar alone is worth going to see, unique tasty salsas. The tacos are big not street tacos, found out after I ordered 5 of them, but had plenty of take homes. Their horchata is the best I've ever had. The place it's self is small so make sure you get there before the rush. But absolutely check it out!	3
What a cute little place this was! The servers were super friendly, and the food was just great! We were surprised by the metallic chopsticks, but they were easier to use than expected. We had the Kalbi and the Bulgogi - both super excellent. The portions are slighhtttly on the smaller side, so you might need to order a few plates to share, but a really nice place overall.	3
Love their chicken gyro, really messy to eat, but worth it. When you order the combo get the oregano fries, really good.  This appears to be a family run business with all the staff very friendly and efficient. You are always asked if you enjoyed the food; so far a resounding yes. And make sure you try the Taziki sauce, yum! Next time you're at Blakeney, give it a try.	3
Excellent dinner. Had a New York Strip steak and Scallops for $22.00	3
Although I'm sure better ramen can be found elsewhere, this is as good as any I've had in Pittsburgh or Philly. Service is always good, and extremely fast (they just spoon some soup out), and the soup is consistently savory and delicious. Always hits the spot.	3
Slow service and didn't give my kids any sauce for their nuggets even though we asked for some. They were not very friendly either	2
Its is a pretty building near lots of places to eat. However no one who works at city hall doesn't have a recommendation for anything! Lame! I was hoping for a spectacular place to eat at while in this neck of the woods.....disappointed. Oh well, on my own I shall venture	2
Their hotel is nice, but their shaving kit is a joke. Had to go out of my way and walk to Walgreen's to get something that even worked. My facial hair isn't even that coarse, but it took going over the same spot 10 times hoping the razor would eventually rip the hair out of your face, since the blades were too dull to cut anything. I gave up, and walked to Walgreen's with a patchy face. The cheapest two-blade plastic razor there was able to finish the job going over my face once.	2
Needs more cigarette filtration and space to sit.	2
Used to visit here quite a lot but since then there have been several new hairdressers (Owners?) and they do not seem to offer the hot shave that I enjoyed so much when the turkish / armenian guy was still there. The girl hairdresser is well competent and very sweet if not a little patronising - as she offered me a sweety after being a 'good boy' when the haircut took place. You could tell it was done often as she had a big jar of the sugar treats! \nHowever I did have a very good haircut, but next time i'd like to leave a place without feeling like a 12 yer old :o)	2
This time I ordered the granola french toast with a juice containing watermelon; apples; kale; blueberries. The french toast was poorly executed. In certain areas it was undercooked and it contained too much granola that was not sticking to the bread properly. When I finished I was left with a plate of granola. The juice was also disappointing and had a watered down taste from the ice they used. \n\nI like the menu here however some of the recipes need tweaking.	2
I've been to the original location in the Strip since writing my Oakland review. It definitely is better overall than the Oakland shop (fries were better, and just tasted fresher), but still nothing too amazing. I think the concept of the sandwich just doesn't do it for me (See Oakland Primanti's review).	2
Went here for mother's day. To me, it was just OK. On the plus side, they have a lot of seafood choices. Fish, sushi, invertebrates, etc. All you can eat. The staff was attentive. The negative: $27.95/each for dinner, so with 5 of us eating, it came to just a little over $150 and some change. For my money and medium appetite, I would rather go to a nice, sit-down restaurant where I can order a decent $25 entree from a menu. Once a year at this place is good enough for me.	2
Really nice facility. Great family fun. Watch out for the pig in the bathroom!	2
Edible meatballs. That's all I can say about those. The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is the amazing milkshakes!!!	2
Great atmosphere, and creative menu! 3.5/5\n\nI went there about a year ago for S's birthday. A big group of us were seated at the patio outside. The atmosphere was great. I like the menu a lot. I remember the food was good but not very spectacular (when considered the price tag...). I only have it a low 4 because of its service. We had poor service that day! I hope the situation has improved since then. I will check back and report out again!	2
This location isn't the best kept, but the food seems to always be decent.  My boyfriend is a regular here now. They even know him by name.  I always get the three finger combo which comes with: Texas toast, three strips, fries, drink, and one Cane's sauce.  I recommend getting extra Cane's sauce because the amount they give you is NOT enough.	2
It's an eat 'n park... don't expect miracles. You go there for a cheap breakfast, decent salad bar and late night munchies. \n\nThe staff have always been kind, I've heard a lot of dick head customers being really nasty to these people and they've handled it with poise.\n\nOkay, so I didn't get that last cup of coffee, my waitress went on a smoke break...again and damn it,I said hashbrowns, not homefries. chill out or go to Wendy's	2
Beautiful, beautiful bar. I absolutely adore the decor - very unique, very inviting, very cozy. \n\nThey have a great drink menu selection, especially for a tequila lover like myself. However, I did get the jalapeno margarita and it was soooo spicy (too spicy for me, and I usually enjoy spicy jalapeno drinks). Over the course of close to an hour I only had a few sips. The bartender even dropped by to give my friend (almost done with her drink) a free drink (with no explanation). I should have spoken up, but I will opt for a nice glass of wine to enjoy this space next time.	2
riddle me this? how does a mexican chicken shop have english speaking workers & right next door at jack-in-the-box no one can understand a word. the service is fast & friendly. very helpful & thorough. the atmosphere was nice-outdoor seating available.very clean. the food is good, a refreshing change from all the fried stuff. an unusual flavor of lime & smoke but good. a little pricey. but lots of coupons available. \nif you haven't tried it i would recommend it especially if you've had enough of the wannabe \"fried\" chicken places	2
Don't be fooled by the 1950's dancing \"girls\" with bikinis on the tv, as some are girls and some are not. This makes for a fun drinking game, but also for some awkward moments. The parking lot is small, the location is a big questionable but inside is a tiki bar feel and affordable drinks. The music is a bit too loud here for my tastes.	2
Decent service awful management, I think my intestines died after trying to eat their overly greasy corned beef hash which took forever to even be brought out on a night which wasn't even busy. The skinny blonde manager acted like he didn't even want to deal with the issues I was having and was even a bit condescending. To compensate I got a 20% discount off of my bill, avoid this place and if you don't want to manage then do something that suits you better like McDonald's drive thru there are teenagers there with better tact.	0
I've only been here once. And that was because I went with someone who knew the bartender and he got us in for free. That specific bartender was cool. He gave us really good deals and let us try new concoctions. But I won't pay to get in (unless it's C-Street because, let's face it, by the end of the night I just don't care if you know what I mean) and I know the drinks are expensive. All in all, it was a nice experience since it was free, but I can't say I would go back unless someone else paid for me to get in.	0
Its a shame I have to give such a bad review, the food was great but the service horrible, that place is dirty. No one at the door to greet me, I had to wait 10 min. for the bartender to finish serving drinks before she could get someone to seat us, then she gave us this attitude like i was disturbing her from king her job. You could write your name on the dust on the shutters and the cigarette smoke smell just makes you think your eating in an ashtray.\nA little hard to locate also. Sorry but I can't go back and it kills me since I am a chicago native and miss the food.	0
Terrible.  Overpriced and the food is close to inedible.  The \"eggs benedict\" were a runny mess smeared on my plate. Noodles were gross.  All the food was flat and shapeless.\n\nIt probably didn't help that I stood 30 mins in line for no apparent reason since there were plenty of empty tables in the place.	0
This review pending a post-event phone call to air grievances.	0
Horrible customer service!  Honestly my worst online experience ever!  Their pictures don't match the product you receive and then charge you a ridiculously high restocking fee to return.  There are plenty of other better companies to choose.  Save your time and money with this one	0
Very disappointed!!! Went there at 1030 am on a SATURDay and they sold the last twelve in front of me! What donut shop runs out on a Saturday? Will not be back.	0
Dave, one of the technicians at Desert Pool is very unprofessional and rude. He was very condescending to both my wife and in addition to quoting us a price and then once he started the work he tried to increase the price on us!  I would suggest calling anyone but them.	0
You can pretty much copy-paste all the previous comments/reviews here too.  \n\nLazy service, under/mismanaged, dirty, poor products.  Unfortunate too, because they have the tools and opportunity to be a really, really neat niche.  The GC in Litchfield Park is WAY better.  C'mon Ground Control, get your managing act together!	0
To be honest with you...... As a previous installer at Arizona sound.. These people care nothing about their customers it is simply sell what they can to whoever they can they will sell to you what you do not need just to make some extra money and talk in their installers into installing it as fast as possible. whether fitment is correct or not.. Customers come in spending thousands of dollars only to return within a few days with the garbage product.... The moral of the story is they sell used for new price and even when you're not paying attention they install other stuff than what you would actually purchased and try to explain to you they're not trying to screw you over	0
I was so disappointed by my dinner here!!! I had a chicken dish that tasted really bad.  The sauce was runny and had an odd flavor. Everyone in our party agreed that the food just wasn't good! It's quite pricey too. I will NOT be returning.  I feel bad for them because a lot of restaurants go out of business on Market Street.  They really need some help here!	0
We have been to China City Super Buffet twice and both times have been bad. I will admit, up front, that I am a little buffet-phobic. Still, if the food is good I can ignore a lot. The food here is not very good at all. Everything is just above room temperature, mushy and flavorless. The utensils are pretty beat up and show signs of wear.	0
I WILL NOT eat here ever again!!! I used to love this place great specials, delivery and good chinese food. The last and final time I ordered from here I got my delivery order and found a handful of baby roaches in my chow mein, that was 3 years ago. I have not eaten here since and I never will return	0
I like the Fitchburg HyVee, but I hate this one. Something always goes wrong. Either we get prepackaged food and it's terrible or they don't have what we want. Either way, my boyfriend and I have made a promise that we'll always take the extra time to go to the Fitchburg location.	0
only gets one star because service was horrible. Food is fairly good. I walked in with my husband and sat at the bar. We were there for late night and we were asked by the guy bartender to move to the corner if we weren't drinking. I wanted to leave right away like who does that? Then he sat 2 girls in our spot and they didnt even have a drink!! none the less he completely ignored us and I swore I would not return to this place	0
The food was great, but the customer service was terrible. I got charged twice for my order (first $37, second being $31) and they showed up at my door the next day with the same food. I don't know why my order or credit info was saved twice, but accidents happen. They took the food back but didn't take away the second charge. I called and talked to the manager and he blew me off saying he would look into it and call me back and I never heard from him again even calling back again and again. Extremely disappointing for such a good pizza place to have ripped me off like that.	0
So, we transferred to the Phoenix area 2 years ago and you know it goes; after we got here we wondered how we were going to find medical providers for all our different needs. Well, luckily I heard about this optometry clinic from colleagues. From day one I felt very welcomed by all the staff. Dr. Olivetti is very nice and extremely knowledgable and  professional. My wife and I go back each year for our annual exams and I'm going to be taking my parents after they move down this fall. I recommend this clinic and Dr. Olivetti without any reservation. Keep up the great work!	4
Newly remodeled very tastefully done, looks like more seating, partly blocked off the kitchen a good thing.  New menu with new items to pick from. Great food and friendly staff. This is not a tasteless 70s Olive Garden.	4
The styles in this terrific little shop are more European and less \"Vegas\" boutique.  I have found unique pieces that you won't see on every other woman in Las Vegas. They range in prices to fit many budgets.  The jewelry and handbags also seem one of a kind.  And to add to the charm of this great place is the staff!  They are very helpful and friendly.  They treat locals very well and that along with the fresh style keeps me coming back.  Thanks BluNoir!	4
good stuff!	4
One of the best places in Charlotte! The chicken and broccoli was very good! The chicken and shrimp fried rice was good as well. It says 2 people could share one item.....not so sure about that.	4
Always do an awesome job. I typically get the $3 wash but I get the hand wax every couple months. They work fast and do a great job, I don't go anywhere else now.	4
This is the only place that I know of that has Only 8 product in AZ. If anyone knows of another place, please share ... because I drive from Pinnacle Peak area to get this yogurt. What other sweet treat can you eat that is so low in carbs, low calorie and therefore guilt free to indulge. Grasshopper is my favorite flavor but hit and miss when they have it. Second best is Peanut Butter which they always have.	4
Ya'll already know how I feel about Lil Ceas.	4
Best breakfast in town as far as I'm concerned! I try to get something different every time and have never been disappointed! Macadamia coconut pancakes.......	4
So pleased with this place every time!\nAlways do great work, great massage when getting pedicure, and super friendly staff and management.\n\nWent in for a chip in my gel manicure to be fixed today (I'm a biter) and they fixed for free.\n\nMy favorite nail spa!!	4
Great people. Everyone is very professional and helpful.	4
With its clean modern lines, brushed stainless steel kitchen, multiple flat screens and skyscraping views of the other Palms towers and the City Center-transformed Strip, Palms Place offers some of the nicest one-bedroom suites in town. If you're looking to buy an in-resort off-Strip condo with ample closet space, give it a serious look.	4
Good Thai food here.  Had laarb kai, chili mint, and pad Thai.  All great dishes and made very well.  I'm a bit surprised that their main competition is across the street, lotus of siam.  Well, food here is definitely good and worth a stop.	4
I really love this store! My fiance and I go there every time we go in to las vegas. They have a very nice selection of yarn. I can't wait to go back.	4
Great food great hummus..the sauce they give you for the fries is awesome. Gyros are really good! Gyro Portion size kinda small for the price. Free baklava w/ yelp checkin and is really good.you can get a tray for 10 bucks for 12 pieces to go and I recommend!! The whole menu looks good and I would definately go again..staff was very friendly.	4
Their staff is really nice and upbeat ! Makes my shopping fun ! :)	4
This Wells Fargo is right behind my house, but never seems to fail me with their drive thru ATM! It's always down or cash is unavailable! It's a huge inconvenience! Why offer a drive up ATM if it's never working for cash!!! This needs to be fixed!	1
