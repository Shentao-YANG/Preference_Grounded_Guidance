4.5 stars\nVery good pizza by the slice and great service and people! Quick, inexpensive, and tasty meal.	1
This is our favorite restaurant period. The staff is friendly and more importantly the food is fantastic. If you are in a rush this is not the place to go. If you want really good authentic Italian food then this is the place.	1
My tongue beat my lips to death.Can we have a Amen ? Why is there not more people here? A Great location . Yumm Yumm I am glad this place is not closer I would be mopping the floors for free. Look  do not take my word for it  fight the traffic losen your belt get a spoon and pray for another cup of that creamy heaven. And my point is...  Mikey tried it and he likes it he likes it...\n I need a larger spoon.	1
"Good pizza place. Fast delivery. Tasted fresh and hot. The \""""Italian special\"""" with garlic, artichoke, tomatoes, pepperoni and sausage was great. Glad I found this place."	1
the burgers here are really good. Everything is made to order and comes to the table hot and fresh. They did some renovations to this location and that may explain their prices. The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the price. If you buy two combo meals the price will run you close to $30.	1
First time eating there last week.  Don't let the outside fool you. Great open space decor. Amazing and diverse menu using local meats and fish. Cheeses and unique tapas change weekly.  I'm embarrassed to say I am a local neighbor for 6 years and never gave tis place a try. I will be a regular.	1
We used Keystone based on the yelp reviews and we were very pleased with the level of service we received.  They were on time and completed the work on 3 carpets in less than 30 minutes.  The price was very fair and the carpets look great.  I would not hesitate to use them again in the future.	1
Love this field! The roof...the fans...the game!	1
One of the best quality Japanese food you will find in town.\n\nThis place has great food. If you're used to eating AYCE sushi, you might be a bit disappointed because of the portions. However, the portions here are perfect for me and the price is fair considering the quality of their food.\n\nSo far, I've had their tempura udon, sushi, several rolls, and the ramen special which they have on Sunday afternoons. I have yet to be disappointed! Every time I went, their service was friendly and overall pleasing. \n\nThe atmosphere is also nice too - quiet and clean.	1
Generally clean, but of course it shows the use of many patrons who don't cleanup after themslves. Usually there's an attendant on duty wiping and sweeping.\n\nThe machines accept an onsite credit card that you'll load with paper money, so don't bother saving up quarters for this place. Oh, and it opens at 6am!	1
Brought kids here to hang out.... it happened to be their first year anniversary so they had a lot of cool deals... but heres is the bottom line... clean, staff is very friendly and places for adults to hang out... cafe is good too... although a little more $ than other places but very worth it..	1
This place is so impressive.  The food was excellent!  The service was above and beyond my expectation.  Very fast service.  The pricing was surprisingly reasonable.  I will definitely come back on my next trip to Vegas.	1
Sushi was fresh. California roll had real blue crab in it not imitation. You get what you pay for. Pad Thai was delicious.  Nice quiet restaurant.	1
The banana chocolate tart was not  too sweet and the chocolate & sugar decoration was crispy.	1
I love going to Todai everytime I visit Vegas. This year, I went with my mom and sis for dinner since we love sushi buffets. I stocked up on all the good stuff, of course... sashimi, the rolls with less rice (so I can eat more =P). All are excellent quality of course. Oh, and the chocolated covered strawberries are so freakin good! Finally, finish it off with crepes and you're set for the night!	1
If you're new to Charlotte and still adjusting to living in the New South, go to Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown. I can pretty much guarantee that the macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, biscuits, meatloaf and all the other soul food will remind you why Charlotte is a good place to live. \n\nYou can order food from Mert's online, which is a convenient perk. I've been to a couple events catered by Mert's. Mm mm.	1
"I don't love Pamela's and almost never went there when I lived in the 'Burgh. But at least, in the summer, there wasn't a long, annoying wait for the mediocre omelets and greasy crepes at this particular location. I have not visited since the remodel, which sounds atrocious. \n\nI kind of like Pamela's potatoes, which are \""""lyonnaise\"""" and taste like a decent hot German potato salad."	0
Took my hubby in for a pedicure. Tech was very sweet but way too aggressive on the callus removal. She cut up his feet pretty badly. He is in pain today! Not going back, obviously. My pedicure was good, thank goodness.	0
We went here on a Thursday night, bleh- I have definitely had better. Don't care to ever go again. Music was good though.	0
If you're looking for competent, friendly, local service on your loan, DO NOT GO HERE. You're better off dealing with the Indian call-center representative of a giant bank, because at least then you know you're dealing with someone who has an excuse for coming off like an idiot.\n\nThese guys are a waste of your time, I'd rather have had my eyelids removed without anesthetic than endure the hassle I went through here.	0
Knowlegable but very pushy and sales-y. He did more talking than listening to me about what my problems are. Was also turned off by the HcG diet advertisement they had outside their door.	0
"Bouncer staff was unprofessional when dealing my group of bicycling friends. Their words \""""we don't like you here\"""" were unneeded and unprofessional. I will not come back here if they don't support bicyclists. Why do they have bicycles hanging over their taps if they don't bicyclists to buy drinks?!?!?"	0
Loved this dog salon when I first started coming here, they made a mistake and cut my dog's marking that we love off. We were disappointed but gave them the benefit of the doubt and still continued to return each time we told them exactly how we wanted it cut and told them not to touch the part they had messed up on before and of course this last time they ignored my requests and cut off that marking again! It's a bit annoying when your paying full price and TIPPING them and they are disregarding your wants. There's too many pet salons around town for me to settle on one and i'd rather go to someone that will listen and value their customers business.	0
This place over charges. My compressor on my ac went bad.  I needed a new one. Instead of a price break down . I got a menu of prices from 4800 to 2400 to put in a new compressor . The diffrence from the 4800 come with  2 yar warrenty vs 2400 comes with 6 months warrenty.  A new compressor  only cost around 1000 and a new system is about 4000.  I dont  recommend this place if you have ac problems.  I went somewhere else and have a new compressor, fan, capacitor put in and only 1700.	0
Gross.\n\nI love Mexican and New Mexican cuisine, but this is just the most bland, arterie-clogging mess.  I've been here three times, and each time has been as bad as the last.  Sadly, they're very close to Solo Cafe, so I've made the poor choice to eat there after a day of studying on occasion.  I always regret it.\n\nNo flavor, lots of styrofoam packaging and plastic utensils, microwaved cheese, and no spice to it.  Save your money.	0
out of business.\n\nthis was a great place to get food...	0
Iced mocha was good. Just good. Not fabulous, but good. And that's really about all I need when I go out and drop $5 on a special coffee.  It's a plus for me if a coffee artist smiles or is kind.  I think the gal who served me was the same person who named the place.  I nearly felt guilty imposing on her.  I'll go Coffee Rush next time because I like to support local.	0
Horrible experience and poor management.. I lived there for several months with no assigned parking, tiny gym, and kept experiencing different maintenance issues. Apartment was brand new but was told there was a water leak inside the kitchen walls, wall was torn apart and I had to live with a hole in the wall until they decided to repair it. Units have no elevators and several residents all had issues with ants. Pet owners did not clean up after their pets and there was a ton of construction.	0
Let me preface this by saying that the food is not terrible (nothing interesting or special, but better than wet newspaper.)  The servers are hit and miss, although our last server was actually very good.  \n\nI'm giving this place one star because the atmosphere is trashy, loud, aggressive, and dirty.  I went into the mens room, and there was vomit all over the floor.  I told a server, who gave me a nasty look and then ignored me.  \n\nSo all in all, this is a great bar to watch an MMA fight and drink jaeger till you puke in a urinal, but not so great for adults.	0
I wasn't all-too pleased with this restaurant. Their coleslaw was good, but their fish, scallops and shrimp came wayyy too overcooked for my taste. I won't be back anytime soon.	0
Last time I ate here everything was over salted and my 5 year old thought the pizza was weird(having tried it I concur). I had one good experience and one terrible one so it will average out.	0
This place is horrible, if you ever had real Ramen you will undrestand what a disaster is this place, terrible terrible food	0
