Called in for same day apt. on a SUNDAY. so awesome that i now know of a place to go to that i really feel comfortable with.Unfortunately I do not know the name of the DR. that saw my baby, Obi. but he was absolutely great! He took his time answering my questions and addressing my concerns. He  went absolutely above and beyond with explaining whats going on with my doggy and giving me suggestions and remedies. Thank you!	1
This place isn't huge, but they still have a good stock of stuff. Looks like a place for the weight loss/body building/fitness enthusiast. Very friendly, not overly pushy staff.	1
This is long over due, I've been coming to European for many years, I have NEVER had a bad or even mediocre experience. Tonia is the BEST, ask for her if you want your service perfected.	1
Oh YUM! This place rocked my universe today! I had a cheap lunch special...mint pork. It came with a drink and white rice for a grand total of $6. I practically licked the plate, it was so darn good. My mouth is watering more from just thinking about it.\n\nI gave it 4 stars because the atmosphere is college-student (though the music is great), but for an under $10 lunch...you won't find anything better.\n\nSerious...yum!\n\np.s. I think the secret is their fish sauce.	1
Good food here. The Italian sub is very good. Quesadillas are good as well. Cheapest besides Burger King in The Rio.	1
My daughter and I stayed here this past weekend for one night and we wish we could have stayed longer. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept in in I can't remember how long! The room was perfectly clean. Kudos to them for letting us check in at 10 am, well before my check in time. \n\nThe hotel is centrally located one block from Ste Catherine which is where the shops are located. A bit of a hike to the Port but not a bad walk. The only downfall is the charge for wifi- it isn't nominal, it's $16 CAD which is quite a bit.	1
Great food. Big portions and small prices. Good service. A must of you have not tried. The Torta Del Reyes is the MOTHER SANDWICH and only $7. Its over two pounds of goodness.	1
Excellent food, desserts and coffee. Very friendly staff and a bright, happy enviroment. Highly recommend you try this place!	1
"Good place to grab a bite-- not your normal airport grub. Breakfast is Served all day. \n\nI had the \""""smothered and covered\""""-- chuck steak with mushroom, onions, and mushroom gravy.  very good. The mashed potatoes were better than most steakhouses. \n\nGood TVs around the bar-- an odd music playlist. Drink selection ok. Employees were high energy and pleasant and accommodating. \n\nTypical airport pricing was the only negative."	1
I realize there are plenty of local coffee shops in Madison, and I love them too, but this one just happens to be on my way to work AND it has a drive through. Sometimes convenience wins. It also happens to have a super friendly and energetic staff that is always so kind and really brightens my morning commute.	1
Fantastic setting.  Wonderful service.  Good food - but not great.\n\nI've been here three times now, and the place is consistent.  It's a very satisfying place to be - great setting (albeit a bit loud due to the beer brewing setup), great people.  Good food (not divine but definitely tasty!) and the beer is pretty good quality - a tad watery.\n\nOverall, though, I'll be back again, I'm sure, because it's just such a fantastic experience overall.	1
I love Pharmaprix! I love the stuff they have (from the store brand to the super expensive brands), the cosmeticians (for the most part) really know their stuff, they always have what I need AND I get extra points when there's specials.. I see NOTHING wrong with this place!	1
The sushi is pretty good and if you catch it at happy hour prices then the tab is CHEAP.  Well worth checking out.	1
I've been here three times with my parents and it's turned into one of our new favorite restaurants! I've tried three of the salads, the grapes and gorgonzola and the antipasto were my favorites however, I wasn't really a fan of the grilled vegetable salad. My parents always get a pizza and I'm not sure which ones they have gotten but they're always really good! I've also gotten the meatballs as an appetizer and they were good but not anything too special. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, they brought my salad just as I had asked for it. Overall, I haven't had a bad experience at this restaurant and the food is awesome!	1
This cigar lounge is at the top of the list. The atmosphere is incredible and provides for a relaxed yet fun night. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. Live music was unexpected and helped make this one of the best lounges I've travelled to.	1
I had the Mediterranean salad and Athena pasta and hubs had the chicken club and green chili cheese dip .... My selections were excellent ... Salad was not over dressed and the half size pasta was huge and I took some home. The chicken club had great flavor only down fall that took them to 4 stars was the chicken was over cooked and dry. Cheese dip was excellent .... Chris (owner) was very friendly and comped our sandwhich which we returned in the form of a tip to our server. These gestures go a long way in our mind and we will return and give the place another chance for sure.	1
The service was very slow. Took forever for drinks. The breakfast buffet was limited but the food was good. Service workers were cold and appeared to want you in and out. Probably wouldn't go back.	0
This was the most disgusting place I have ever been to, I am so seriously surprised that the health department is allowing this place to stay open, I found an unidentified object in my soup, this place was so nasty, the windows you cannot see out of from the filth, the food is GROSSSSSSSS. This is just a depressing environment, not a place to waste 10.00 on a meal.	0
Took a longer/more expensive route to save 2 minutes and then took 8 minutes to get change from other cab drivers.	0
Fun food but AWFUL SERVICE our meals took forever to make it to the table and the waitress mite as well been none existent. Definitely not worth the 40min wait to get a table (when there was empty tables everywhere)	0
This place is convenient because I work at CityScape but the service from the employees is HORRIBLE and my clothes have come back wrinkled several times now. I would not reccomend this place.\n\nI've gone in and asked questions about my charges and the main employee gives me a dumb founded look every time. She never greets me when I walk in and will ignore me until she feels she is ready to help me out...when I am the only customer in there.	0
Hot water problems, heater problems, dried urine on the toilet seat, and I'm writing this review on the $9 a day internet.	0
I just don't get all the rave reviews, unfortunately there is no real good breakfast on this side of town. Go to Hash House if you want a real breakfast.  My wife and I ate here, hoping for the best, received salty as heck greasy chicken fried steak. They haven't got a clue how to prepare this American staple... Go to Omelette House  if you want bigger bang for your dollar and tastier food.	0
I just read the owner comment to my review & lowered to 1-STAR. The worst customer service!!	0
After visiting many of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants in London, this was a complete let down. I'm not sure how much Mr Ramsey is associated with the restaurant but this was without doubt the worst $250 meal for two we've ever had. The quality of the ingredients was not what you would expect for a al carte. The drinks were the best part of the meal.	0
The customer service along with management are very unpleasant. I let the manager know but doubt he will say or do anything. The cashier Rosemary always leaves a bad taste in my mouth and upset as I leave. She is selective with who she is nice too and never smiles or greets. The store is super organized but I would rather shop at albertsons where it's a comfortable happy environment. They need to hire people who are happy to work with customers	0
Came here on a groupon. Had bacon wrapped shrimp. good flavors, but the shrimp was over done. Typical beans and rice. Nothing special. The food did come to the table hot. Nothing really stands out about this place.	0
"Friendly staff. Had a free oil change offer so was using that. It just takes too long though. Feel bad saying that because great staff and good service but wouldn't recommend just for oil change. Had an \""""appt\"""" for 3 pm car wasn't pulled around until 330. And I'm still waiting. As usual told me what else needs done to car but otherwise almost done. That was 15 mins ago. Free oil change only reason came here because wait time is too long."	0
"Been here a few times since my initial fish fry review and can't say that I've been impressed. The service has been consistently poor/sub standard. Drinks are always served in plastic cups... tap selection isn't anything to write home about, and the food is largely hit-or-miss.\n\nI don't believe that I can recommend this place; it's clear that unless you're there for the fish fry, and unless you sit in the traditional seated section, you'll have a less than stellar experience.\n\nToo bad, because the place had potential. But, after at least six or seven visits since my first review, the place has been \""""off\"""" every time."	0
I ate here just because of the convenience factor, but the food was way overpriced and very dry. Also, the bus boy spilt scalding hot coffee over my hand and the table and didn't say anything. He came back with a few napkins and placed them on the table and didn't clean it up. Manager wasn't much help and didn't really do anything. If I was the manager, I would of made the meal complimentary and apologized profusely. \n\nLuckily the waiter was a decent guy so I still gave a decent tip. I wouldn't recommend this place to any friends and the customer service needs some work.	0
Haven't eaten in the restaurant, being new to the area we called in an order for take out.  On the plus side, it was ready in 15 minutes.  Negatives, the telephone answering person spoke English so poorly I wasn't sure what we would get.  The food was on balance pretty dreadful.  Bland, gelatinous to a fault, every dish tasted like pablum except the shrimp fried rice.  We won't  do this again.	0
oh my god, what a shitty piece of pizza. this is a tourist trap. shitty floppy bland pizza smothered in grease, charged me 50 cents to use my credit card? we only stumbled in here cause we were buzzed and uncle Joe's pizza was already closed down the street (we heard it was awesome). this place is cheap to say the least, and the pizza was extremely crummy, bleh!	0
