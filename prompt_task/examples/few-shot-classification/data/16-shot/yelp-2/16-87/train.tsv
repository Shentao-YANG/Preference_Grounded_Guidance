Damn good dogs and cold beer. What's not to like.	1
So far, Green Mango is my new favorite Thai restaurant. We came here with a friend, a regular patron, who introduced us to the owner and the rest of the staff. Everyone was so nice and it felt like you were with close friends who put love into the food. Every dish we ordered was spiced and cooked to perfection. As I'm writing this review my mouth is salivating for some pineapple curry and pad thai! I can't wait to go back.	1
We met with three different contractors and picked Steve. Our house was not easy - had odd wall texture that was difficult to paint over,  multiple walls that were painted in deep blue and brown colors that required several coats, stencil work in several rooms that needed to be painted over. Steve and his crew, Jesus, Juan and Walter, could not have done a better job. Furthermore, they were always punctual, very professional and considerate. Steve also was very fair on the price of last-minute add-ons and he didn't mind that we picked three different colors. We'd recommend his company to any one.  Bonus - he always seems to be a good mood. Cheery fellow.	1
Lovely hotel. Staff is professional, helpful, and polite. Hotel is beautiful. People inside are well dressed. Everything in the hotel is just very pleasing to the eyes. Great restaurants inside and the best clubs.	1
My wife and I went here tonight after previously going to Takara's other location on the west side of town. Both times, I have walked away pretty impressed with the sushi there.\n\nFull disclosure: I am by NO means a sushi connoisseur, or even someone who knows much about sushi. When we go out for sushi, my wife usually just orders a variety of rolls and I sample everything.\n\nHowever, I have eaten at a handful of different sushi joints, and Takara has consistently been one of the better ones I've sampled. The service was blisteringly quick, the drinks were pretty good, and the sushi was excellent. \n\nWe will definitely be back!	1
Went this morning with my girlfriend and we got almost the same thing. The home fries where just a little under cooked but everything else we had was great. The pancakes where amazing and the food came out lightning fast.	1
WE have a family membership here and it is worth every penny.  The stingray exhibit is worth the money.	1
Very nice hotel! Would easily stay here again.\nOnly bad part is that to get to the pool area you have to walk a mile, with kids this gets to be a pain. Other than that, no complaints!	1
I can't believe that guy that complained about the prices going up. He's lucky to get ammo at any price the way things are going! He must live in a cave. I've been buying from UN Ammo for about a year - mostly online and once in person (during their grand opening). I read about them at www.blogspot.randomammo.com . The prices were the lowest I could find. It was nice meeting them and all but it's their low prices that keep me as a customer.	1
Six of us for dinner - adults and teens - fabulous food - we'll definitely be back. Vegan & vegetarian dishes so tasty. And very reasonably priced.	1
This is an update to my previous review, When I sent the payment in, with a letter explaining why we shouldn't be responsible for the charged, I was sent a letter telling me that Dr. Glick decided to waive the charge. This has restored my faith in all the great things I have heard about this office. I will go again and I will make sure that I know what my coverage should be. Thank you Dr, Glick!!!!	1
Everything was delicious from Caprese Salad, mussels, linguini with clams and the ginormous meatballs, and last but not the least Tiramiso for dessert - superb!	1
Just returned from a restaurant week experience with my parents. Veranda far exceeded my expectations of venturing off the isthmus, and the whole table thoroughly enjoyed it. I devoured some melt-in-your-mouth short ribs. 5th star goes to our personable and professional waiter, Keith (?). Great service!	1
Went to 1oak on a recent friday. My friends and I got bottle service to celebrate a friends birthday. I had been to 1oak a few times before, but this was my first time getting bottle service at 1oak. Everyone was friendly, and Hector VIP host made me and my friends feel true vip. As the night when on Hector moved us to a better table on the dance floor. There was no room on the dance floor to dance, but the music was great. I will come back soon.	1
This place is awesome. I wish I had known about this place when I got to Vegas. \nI plan to eat breakfast here and take a few other meals back to my hotel room so I don't have to worry about my food. I recommend this place to all foodies. It's not too pricey and everything looks very good.\nThe staff is also very  friendly.	1
We went to the one outside the venetian. It was romantic. The guy was singing and it was a smooth ride. I'm a big girl and my husband is a big guy so we were a little apprehensive about going but the ride was smooth. The ONLY downfall is we didn't get a private ride we had to share it with another couple. But they were pretty nice so it was all good.	1
Going in to look for a Starbuck's plastic cups.  Didn't find the one we are looking for...  The staff was not so friendly.	0
To be quite honest and simple, Gardunos made me miss home.  Not because if reminded me of home in any way, but because at home I could get a real Mexican meal for half the cost and 3 times the service.  Bland is not a descriptive enough word to describe the food, and the server was nowhere to be found really until a bus woman would get her attention to get us more drinks.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars because the bartender had a heavy hand in pouring jack and cokes.	0
No coors light on draft, no new castle in stock, and they don't take discover card. Thankfully the wings were good and the server was friendly. Still not a top recommendation.\n\nOn the second trip, no surprises: still out of new castle and the wings were obviously frozen (small, spongy, and tasteless). Never going back to this place.	0
This is a hotel for a couple night stay not for a long period of time. The bed was hard and the pillows too soft. The front desk clerk in the morning had a major attitude for what who knows. Like I said good for a 1-2 night stay only	0
I'm becoming less enticed by the store simply based on it's customer service. There is never a friendly cashier. They are clearly disgruntled and distracted, most likely with other pressing responsibilities. \nI have also noticed that there is never more than one cashier, so the lines stack in to the aisle, and they don't call for help.\nMaybe that has something to do with the attitudes of the clerks?\nI'm going to check out Big Lots in Centennial and see if the service is any friendlier, but if it seems to be a trend I'll probably stop going all together.	0
Another ridiculous Friday nite wait at LGO for Curbside. Couldn't even park. And, the order was incomplete. They gave me a $50 gift card. But that only means I have to go back to use it. Is it worth it?	0
By far the worst food i have had in Phoenix... Service is extremely bad.. We had to wait for 20 minutes before someone showed up to take the order. And then it took them another 40 minutes to get the appetizers, which had gone cold by then. \n\nDefinitely not worth the money.	0
over priced and overrated	0
WOW! I normally wouldn't review a gas station but this place is so bad I felt it warranted it. The angle of the lanes is absurd and it seems everyone there is pissed about something.	0
"Only gave 2 stars, because when I mentioned Military discount the lady behind the register looked at me like I was crazy, she said \""""no discounts here, we don't even get employee discounts\"""" REALLY, !!! Employee discounts !!. I did more for this country in Iraq, than that lady will do her life at the restaurant, Your welcome lady !!!! I think she could of been a little more appreciative."	0
I had looked forward to visiting the Inglot store during my next visit to Las Vegas. I told my girl friends about the system and they were excited also. We took a cab from our hotel specifically  to go the mall for  this store. Well I can't say the customer service was bad, because the young lady in the store around noon on 6/25/14 did not give any. She basically gave me a tray and  told me to pick some colors.  No help with coordinating a palette of colors . I finally walked out . I will continue to order online or wait until my next trip to Chicago.	0
bad bad bad dinner. the food is not tasty. the price are very high. i dont recommend this place at all !	0
A part here cost me $24. Found same part at Home Depot for $8. Won't be back!	0
This place blows. I guess if you're absolutely desperate to eat you'll end up here @ the end of the night. The staff & service sucks as bad as the food does.	0
They are the most unprofessional business I have ever had to deal with. The scheduling is a nightmare....back and forth emails that never ended in a solution. They are obviously not into putting their customers first or providing excellent services. Once you purchase the services from them through Groupon the money is immediately taken from your credit card but then you have to wait 2 months to even get on the schedule. Then the week of your appointment they send an email to reschedule and word it as if you are the one that needs to reschedule. I wish I would have read the other negative customer reviews about The Cleaning Solution before I purchased this waste of time!	0
Sub I got was mostly bread. The bread is good but they barely put any meat on it and tasted like all bread. I got the Italian It was my first time and I noticed on the menu it said double meat for $$ extra and I did not get extra meat but should have because It tasted like all bread. I don't think I will go back.	0
