Yummy drinks for brunch and delicious pastry basket. The eggs Benedict has a nice twist and the potatoes are very tasty. I can't wait to go again for a special occasion.	1
By far the best Chinese in this area. Not only is sooo good but the food is always consistent. \n\nI always get the Sweet & Sour Chicken. YUM! And the Wonton Soup is good too however I wish they put more wonton noodles in it. The vegetarian spring rolls are the best! The crab puffs are also good.\n\nThere food is by far better than Flo's. NO chewy fat on any of the meat at Jade Palace! And I know that every time I either order take out our dine it, its going to be great food!	1
The Tax Goddess is the business you want to work with when dealing with bookkeeping, taxes, and payroll. They have friendly staff that treats you well, and looks out for your best interest. If you are looking for a local firm, you have found it, The Tax Goddess! You will be pleased that you did!	1
Great little place, though a little hard to find. Nice light food, very friendly service.	1
Would not come here during the weekends! Just like any bars, it gets packed and they start charging covers. Seriously? It's downtown!\n\nBest time to go: Wednesdays. They have drink specials and it doesn't get packed. The rooftop is even more amazing. \n\nThe bottom line is that drinks are amazing but how long are you willing to wait to get them?	1
Good place to go after your shopping in princess street.Has a good selection of food on the menu to chose from.Its not to pricey either.The staff were polite.	1
What a great find!  I live close by and decided to stop in for lunch.  The Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich was incredible...very tasty.  Huge sandwich!  The Ahi Tuna Salad was delightful, with a yummy miso vinaigrette and crunchy wasabi peas.  I will definitely go back to try dinner!	1
I love Filly B's! I'm usualy a Country Burrito fan, but I tried something different today and it was still delish! Nice guy working the cash register. It's close to my apartment and open late.	1
It's a little hard to find because it's in the Wood Fired Pizzeria place!\n\nThe selection of flavors is huge. I enjoyed the Salted Caramel while cooling off on the front porch.\n\nNice helpful wait staff. Clean place, I like the concept if the two types of eateries together.	1
"Remember the famous movie \""""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\""""? Well my dear friends embarked on a journey to Earl of Sandwich. \n\nWas it worth it?? Yup, The Caribbean Jerk Chicken was my favorite. The swiss cheese and bell peppers gave it the perfect \""""party in your mouth\"""". The bread is toasted to perfection. Must def try."	1
I've been a member for about 3 months and so far so good.The massages are nice, they have aromatherapy available which is awesome, but you do have to remind them you want it. They place hot towels on you after your massage which is nice as well. If you are like me with horrible neck and shoulders I would definitely recommend Tara.	1
I lived right behind this shop for 3 years. I would literally trust these guys with my life. I can't say that about most people, let alone a car mechanic. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful people.	1
Nicole is simply amazing. I have been a member for approximately  4 yrs and Nicole is the best masseuse I've had. She is detailed and hit all my problem areas. It feels like treatment not just a massage.	1
It wasn't like the sonoran hotdogs down in tucson that I have had. But this was a pretty good one for what I've had up here in phoenix.\n\nA little pricey for a sonoran hot dog.\n\nJust incase you want to comment on how i said it was pricey, read it in the context first... FOR A SONORAN HOT DOG.	1
Intimate and and absolutely delicious...muscles, flatbreads, lamb, risotto...it's all amazing and expertly crafted. The flavors sing and the wines are beautifully chosen. Do yourself a favor, go and put your experience in the Chef's hands. Eat and drink what he recommends.  It's a gem of a place and one I am grateful to have in my hood!	1
AMAZING Guacamole del Barrio is a signature dish and worth the trip in and of itself! The Guac is made table-side, ultra fresh and unique. Also highly recommend Esquites (small buttered and roasted corn dip) that was fantastic! Small, intimate atmosphere that is very enjoyable. Most of our party ordered a version of the Taco dishes and were quite pleased. I ordered the Pescado del Mar - absolutely fantastic! It's rich and filling, so I ended up sharing with table mates ... and they were thankful!\nBarrio Cafe is on my must return list, likely every time I'm in Phoenix. WOW.	1
All I saw was drugs dealing fights! This place is a big joke! They should shut this place down! Rooms for the inn they give you a place to sleep eat and shower and they talk about god what to know your story! Than go on to say money is bad but the people saying in jumping in to benz high dollar cars funny bullshit here it made me think of PTL telling you shut this place down!	0
This place is hit or miss and the late night drunks are not enjoyable either. I have rolled up and seen many cops outside and I am curious as to what is going on for them to be outside a pizza place but it seems they have trouble there from time to time. I think the pizza is so-so, sometimes its pretty good and other times its garbage. I recommend Jamies Pizza and Pita down the street, better service, pizza and its quieter. The only good thing is the Gus's stays open all the time.	0
Went here to watch the World Cup 2014.\nService?  There was none.  Complete and utter failure.\nWe actually tried to go to see the US match, but was turned away because we didn't make reservations.  That was fine.  \nThis time we had reserved a table, but it didn't matter because the staff was completely unprepared for the event.   Kind of crazy since they are known to be a soccer viewing sports bar.  Rather disappointing.	0
DO NOT GET YOU NAILS DONE AT NV! \nI got gels and they chipped the next day. In addition, she shaped my nails lopsided. The nail tech was irritable and unsocial. She did not know how to do a simple flower design.  She obviously did not know what she was doing. It was a horrible, horrible job! I will never go back.	0
Normally my experience is good here, but tonight I ordered a side of the fries/cheese and almost got sick. The plastic coating on the bottom if the box melted into the food and thankfully we caught it before eating too much.	0
This restaurant is at the Corner of my street at is a convenient  place for a little bite to eat. Staff are nice but the price is to much for the quality you reserve. Not the best Indian meal I have ever had. It is a bit dated and its reputation is better than in reality.\nWouldn't tell people not to go but there are better Indian restaurants close by.	0
OMG!! That was the worst ever. I was so completely disappointed with this restaurant I can not believe it. We went in at 7:30 and they were out of all seafood - no shrimp, no scallops, and believe it or not even plain fish either. The service was mediocre if not a tad rude and the portion sizes were paltry. I would have preferred PF Chang's, and we all know how Chinese that place is ...	0
Nice location but the food was very disappointing.	0
Ever since the new management company took over it's just gone downhill. They have closed down the clubhouse, the fitness center and now the pool (scheduled for July) already without notifying their residents in advance. There is no communication from either the management company (PB Bell) nor from the office staff. It really shouldn't be a surprise that so many long term residents are leaving - they're as sick of this as I am. It looks like it's time for me to move also ....	0
Just to let pple know.. I got burnt at this place, the burns turned into dark spots. Go to a dermatologist instead	0
Shitty staff, and the worst drink prices in Vegas. Don't go... it's really just not worth it.	0
I was told by a fellow yelper that this place has fresh lamajune, so we decided to check it out, They have lots of good looking pastry and lamajune was on the menu up on the wall but when we ordered it they said they were out waste of a trip, maybe if I'm on that side of town again ill stop in and try again.	0
Absolutely worst Petsmart ever. If you are there to buy fish, good luck. Never anyone around. The two times I went here, I had to wait 10min. for someone to come out. When I realized no one would, I had to yell through the back door to get someone. The cashier just stared at me instead of paging someone. Also you will wait in line forever. If the cashier has a problem, you might as well take a nap. No one will come to help. Lastly you can never get out of their parking lot without waiting at the light for at least 2 cycles.	0
I really cannot give this place any stars except for one and that was because the server went above and beyond. \n\nThe food was horrible. The calamari was left under the heat lamp and was chewy. Why so much iceberg in my salad. We had chicken marsala, and the chicken was so over cooked that I couldn't chew it. We had a fish course and although the fish was cooked perfectly,  it was luke warm. All in all, the experience was not what I would have expected. Next time I choose to drive that far for Italian, I'll pay a little more and go somewhere else.	0
When this place first opened I was so excited to have an ice cream store close by and one that I could walk to.  They served Lapperts ice cream, which is delicious!  However, the last time I went I found that they had changed ice cream brands.  The flavors were not as good and the ice cream was definitely not as rich and creamy as Lapperts.  So needless to say I was disappointed and won't be returning.	0
Went here for 1-year anniversary. Over-priced food where 50 and 60 year old townies and professors eat.\n\nYou've been warned.	0
