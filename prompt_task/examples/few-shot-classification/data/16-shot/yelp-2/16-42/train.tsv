Amazing food, outstanding service, great bar staff.\n\nIt's a bit loud, and if you have a large group, you'll pretty much be resigned to talking to the people immediately around you, but that's ok.	1
Great Pho, loved there fast friendly service. \nDefinitely recommend to all Vietnamese food lovers!	1
I grew up with this as my neighborhood grocery store so it's got a space in my heart.  I never gave it much thought, though, until I noticed it swanked it up big time in order to beat off the Goliath that is Whole Foods.  Rock out, Sentry.  You'll always be my favorite.	1
I love this place.  The menu always tempts me with several alternatives.  Sitting outside is great when the weather is clement.  Indoors is cozy.  The service is friendly and effective.  The espresso is excellent. Enjoyed the black bean wrap this morning.	1
Easily the best Asian food I've had in the valley. I'll be coming back here, and you should too.	1
I immediately got board with the hand held guide. But the attractions were very interesting. They had someone standing next to the piranha display so the hillbilly's wouldn't hurt themselves. The sting-ray petting tank was the highlight. When I got there they were just about to feed them. They had a live person explaining the habitat and their situation. That sparked up the whole event. At the end of the reef you end up in the hull of an old ship and the sharks, saw fish etc are swimming above, below and on all sides. That was cool. Worth the price of admission	1
They don't call it Amazing Chicken for nothing. This place was an excellent Yelp find and I would have to agree with many of the reviewers. I have eaten here quite a few times since finding it on Yelp and they have yet to disappoint. The sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken and amazing chicken are excellent.	1
Superbe endroit! Service parfait, cadre enchanteur! J'adore!	1
Excellent food.  Bought a Groupon as I had not tried the place and was very happy I did.  It is close to my office and will be a go-to place for lunch now.  They were a little under-staffed and the wait was long for lunch but the food was well worth it.	1
This place is always great, been here many times over the years and aside from Trevi it's one of my favorite places to go have a drink and relax after some serious shopping. The service is always good, as well as the venue, the drinks, and the food. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the hostess this time was a little too forward with her life story for us knowing her for 5 minutes. It was a little too personal, and professionally very inappropriate. But other than that, everything was and always is great.	1
"Ate here again with my son.  The appetizer \""""cheese squares\"""" were just simply amazing!  Service was quick, efficient, and friendly.  \n\nThe ribs we shared were delicious, hot, and tender.  Both my son and I agreed we would be back!\n\nEnjoy!"	1
I came here a few weeks ago with my roommate, it was abut 30 minutes before closing, the line was out the door, literally. There was only one girl working that anybody to see, she handled every order so well, i would have probably ripped my hair out looking at that ever growing line, but she did so well, it didn't take too long for her to get through the multiple orders, she was awesome, i wish i could remember her name. I also find it weird that she had no help, she handled it, but it really looked like there should have been some help. The ice cream is obviously always good here, i could never complain.	1
I went to see Dr. Bigler with my MRI's and he scheduled a surgery for the following week.  The entire staff and surgery center were experienced, friendly and professional.\n\n3 days after surgery, I feel great.  I couldn't have been more fortunate following my experience with another orthopedic doctor/clinic in Las Vegas (please see my other reviews).	1
Great menu, well prepared and excellent service. A foodie joint.	1
Only one word comes to mind when I think about this hotel - BOOM! The room and decor were enough for 4 stars, but the staff really cranked up the rating. Best hospitality staff I have ever encountered! Be sure to check out the restaurant for some crazy drinks you would never think of making on your own.	1
They've clearly been doing something right these past 58 years. \n\nBest onion rings you will have in your life!  The breading on them is not thick and crumbly and the onions texture is spot on.  ALWAYS order the rings.\n\nThe burgers are tasty as are the fries.  Next time we'll try the chicken. And there will be a next time and a time after that. \n\nThis place is a true classic, good food, good service and great atmosphere.	1
I don't like this one much- it's too crowded- it's even worse in the parking lot; good luck finding a space. The lines inside are pretty long, even with many stations open. When I used to live in the area a long time ago, it wasn't as ghetto, but it's clearly there now. I dislike going to this one but my MIL lives in the sunrise area and sometimes we will come here for something out of convenience.	0
This place is closed. They filed for bankruptcy. \nhttp://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/06/scratch_pastries_phoenix_scottsdale_closes.php	0
We decided to try it out for Valentines day.  I can easily say we won't be going back there anytime soon.  The service was terrible, and the food was far from traditional.  My Chicken Lime salad was just a salad with chicken in a tortilla bowl with ranch dressing.	0
How do you screw up oatmeal?!  Quick service was the only positive.  There was a foreign object in my ramekin of raisins.  The oatmeal was lukewarm at best and the consistency was suspicious. I realize you sort of check your expectations of fine dining at the TSA check but it's oatmeal.  With all the other choices in this airport, I will go elsewhere next time.	0
The shrimp enchiladas were good but the service is marginal at best.   They have a great attitude and are friendly but not very attentive.   Waiting to pay for 15 minutes. And they still have not come by.  Good thing is we had the patio to ourselves.   I would give it another try if we are in the area just to see if it was a fluke.	0
The place is nice as it is decorated with interesting fish in fish tanks all over the place. The service here is horrible. The waitresses are rude. The food is nothing special and super expensive. Do not recommend, especially if you have kids that hate waiting 30+ min for their food:/	0
"Saw Zumanity last week. Was underwhelmed as my expectation bar of a Cirque de Solei-branded show was set pretty high. As one of the other commenter's said, this was more of a cheesey burlesque revue than an dazzling acrobatic performance. \n\nWhen we bought our tickets (from Ticketmaster), I was only given seats on the side of the stage that were \""""best available\"""" and cost the same as the seats n the front. \n\nTIP: DONT BUY SEATS ON THE SIDE - THE SET IS STAGED FOR FRONT VIEWING ONLY."	0
Chewy crepes, hard to digest. Overpriced for the quality. Touristy.	0
I agree with Veronika O. Dr Teng's office manager/sister is the nasiest, rudest and most arrogant  person I've dealt with in the medical field. It's amazing he still has a practice with the way his office is run. Even the staff at Mountainview Hospital don't want to deal with her. When I had surgery there and they needed a form from his office, they asked me to call because they didn't want to deal with her. i also told my family Dr never to refer him again. There are other surgeons, find someone else.	0
Subpar and Bland cupcakes. Much better can be had within 2 miles of this place. Keep looking.  $3.75 or a single cupcake!?!? LOL\n\nTry The Coffee Shop or Designer Cakes	0
I usually order on-line for quick pick ups at the Cheyenne location and would assume all Chipotle locations would deliver the same results. \nHowever when you DO order online for this location, BE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE LEAVING. This location always seem to fail at the online order part. \nI had guacamole that was not even mashed and toppings missing. Order was all but correct. \nThere is much to improve for the online order for this one so I'll leave it at that. \nBut gosh, MASH your guacamole right! lol	0
I'm not one to write a bad review at all, but I expect excellence when I pay something. I have been trying to get an item served for over a month and John stated that he went to the apartment about 7 times, but never was able to get ahold of the defendant. I hired another process server and he promptly delivered the service I requested in a day. Seems kind of fishy to me. Seemingly great guy, but if you want someone who gets things done I would look for someone else.	0
One star for the atmosphere besides that the food was really bad I got the grilled cheese sliders and they were just plain gross. The cheese was nasty and tastes like it was fried in old grease. Harsh I know.	0
Food was fair. We have been to the other Roys at JW much better. Had steak which was fair for the price. Mashed potatoes had no taste and looked like cheap instant potatoes. Deseret was sent back as it was cold and not fresh. In the end we paid like $80 for meal. It was a waste of money. Won't go back to this one again.	0
Went in on a friday night, we were seated in a far corner away from everyone else, our waitress kept forgetting about us, didn't want to get us refills, my husbands limeade was nasty, and we could see our food sitting in window for the longest time, with so many other restaurants in the area, we won't go back	0
I like going to WOB for drinks.  Their cucumber martini is really good and worth a try!  They have lots of beer options like you would expect.   The service tends to be less than average especially for a place that doesn't serve food.	0
