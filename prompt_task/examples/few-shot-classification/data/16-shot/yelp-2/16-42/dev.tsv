I've been coming to this place for over 15 years is a wonderful Mexican restaurant the food is very good and the price is incredible and their plates are enormous.	1
I was in town from LA shooting over at Arizona Virtual Studios, and needed a place to grab an easy, affordable, and somewhat healthful meal for my crew. I've been burned many times by picking a local eatery to pick up lunch. Still, I rolled the dice and was more than happy with our meal. Ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Our large order was ready in only fifteen minutes. Big thumbs up to Sack's, and I'll be using them when I'm back in town at this location.	1
Gyro salad was big it equals 2 meals for me. Most popular item that everyone I saw getting was the gyro pita meal.\n\nAnd the gyro meat melts in your mouth	1
Coca Cafe is my favorite brunch at Pittsburgh!\nThe special menu for Sunday brunch is worthy to try.\nI will suggest my friends try savory meals, because it's really awesome!	1
Brushetta with your choice of toppings!! I'm in.!\nCute wine bar, reminded me of home in San Francisco.\nPrices were right and a great selection of wine.\nTotally, hip, cool and happening wine bar.\nThey offered great service, willing to move our party from bar to outside patio when an opening came up. So nice they even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel.  I'm coming back when in town! Wish there was another closer to home!	1
Hey- it's Harbor Freight.  As long as you don't buy anything that might be life threatening you should be good.  \n\nMAKE SURE YOU USE THE 20% off coupon that you find about everywhere!  It helps although without it, things are still cheap.  We bought hammers, a grinder, etc. there.  I think if I really needed a drill, saw, etc.  I might spend the extra bucks and go to Sears, but all the other stuff seems OK.  It's not going to last a lifetime, but it will get you job done.	1
Just got pack rat damage fixed. We had brought the vehicle to another place for a quote. The other place wanted an engine shampoo on top of an unnecessary fix. We visited Royal Car Care in Tempe today, and the service was fantastic, as was the price. They did a quick fix while we waited and the price was very reasonable! Seriously wonderful people. I highly recommend them. I'm going there for all future repairs!	1
One of the better locations around town, this one has a drive thru and a patio! While the patio is nothing major as it looks out over the parking lot (typical Las Vegas views), it does provide a nice option to enjoy the nice weather that graces us for a total of three months out of the year.\n\nThey're very speedy here, and customer service has always been top notch! The employees are patient and take their time with you, and the drinks are fabulous as always.	1
Amazing Breakfast, eggs were perfectly cooked, hash browns were delicious, and the French toast was amazing, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Yummy!!!	1
Beautiful!!! This is where im gonna stay next time!! The decor and furniture is ohhh sooo chic.	1
Very good Hibachi Grill with friendly service!\n\nBeen here once on a busy FRIDAY night, and once on a quiet weekday lunch. Try to find a BOGO coupon in the Savings Books. The steak they use  is NY STRIP, and very tasty. Lunch portions are obviously smaller. We opted out of the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi and Hibachi grill lunch for $9.\n\n\nYou won't be disappointed. Serivce was a little slow, but that's the only negative.	1
Very good Thai reminds me of my favorite place back home... Chicken satay is awesome... My favorite dish is the Elephant garlic Beef... It's awesome and their soy sauce is not your typical Kimlan (even thought its in a Kimlan jar) and is amazing!!	1
Good food. Great biscuits and fresh OJ.\nIf you want a traditional breakfast, Black Bear is the place!	1
If you are rushing from point A to point B, and find yourself at the intersection of 27th Ave and Camelback, this Jack In The Box will get your order right.  I've picked up many a Diet Coke here, plus the occasional lunch.\n\nSometimes it's busy, but you can count on friendly service and accurate order fulfillment.	1
These guys were referred to me by a friend who was very satisfied with their price and service.  They put on a whole new roof for me and I too was more than pleased and have since referred them to others.  Another home we own has a small leak from last week's storm.  I called New Life this afternoon, they remembered who I was, and they are coming to look at my problem Wednesday.  If my future experience with this company changes, I will update the review but my experience with New Life Roofing has been excellent.	1
Great place, but I'm knocking off a star, because they made my friend and I move off the couch when more people came in.  I don't like to be moved around when I am trying to relax after a long day.  I don't even care if they sat next to me, but if I am lucky enough to grab a couch when I go to one of these places, I don't want to have to get off of it.	1
"I wanted a full body massage and looked up reviews on this place so I decided to go.  They did do a full body massage but totally skipped my feet.  Also, when it was over, I asked them to call me a cab.  They said it was easier to go out to Sahara and hail a cab.  So, I tried and ended up having to walk up Sahara (and this is NOT a good part of town) until I found one.  Also, I wanted a more \""""sensual\"""" massage and they do not do that here.  I would skip this place and go somewhere else."	0
The chicken fingers used to be really good when they first opened. Loved the ultra thin shoestrings fries too. But now the chicken is undercooked, not the quality it used to be as the crust tastes like ordinary chicken fingers you can get from the drive-thru. The fries are no longer the thin shoestring but regular fries. I'm disappointed because the last 2 times within the last month wasn't a good experience. Please go back to the original recipe and bring back shoestring fries.	0
Terrible. Meat. Terrible.\n\nTerrible. Dressing. Terrible.\n\nCorporate Garbage that Sand Paper Palette Eating People really like. \n\nNEVER AGAIN!	0
This place kinda blows, it's pretty on the inside. The service is pretty weak. The food is always lukewarm, doesn't really have that fresh taste quality. I've gone twice now and the only appealing part was the rice pudding. Sucks because john cutter's is always on point!	0
I headed here for a Sunday morning hangover cure. I ordered the carne asada nachos. It came with complimentary strands of long black hair.	0
El Hefe looks like a good place and the decor is fairly hip... Although it does seem out of place on Mill and better suited for Scottsdale. At first glance the menu seems tasty and original, but upon first bite you quickly realize that it's all about appearances because the portions are small, expensive and aren't huge on flavor.\n\nThe bar is lame because they aren't even trying to highlight our amazing local breweries here in phoenix... The wait staff however is nice so that part is good.\n\nOverall, it's better to check out a real pub like Rula Bula.	0
When this place opened several years ago, it was decent for chain pizza. I picked up a pepperoni pizza earlier this year. They've clearly slipped. The pizza was greasy and orange, without a crisp crust. The ingredients were low-end; all I could taste was oil.\n\nPizza Patron doesn't deliver and has no seating. It is takeout only and I think it may only take cash (although they do take both US and Mexican currency -- I kid you not). It is cheap, around $5-6 for a single topping. They have some pizzas always ready, in case you can't wait.	0
One word.........GROSS! My boyfriend and I stayed there and it was like we walked into a nightmare. The first room we had was absolutely filthy.....lets just say the maids are NOT doing their job. They upgraded us to a renovated room but even though it was better I was still traumatized and uncomfortable but whatever we had no time to look for something else. The casino was a huge pack of cigarettes I seriously do not know how people go there let alone work there. The front desk was nice however. The Sourdough Cafe was far from good it was ok but the service is ridiculous and the waitresses and stupid slow. Never again. Stay away! The Orleans is much better.	0
These Ladys where allllllll up in my business.\nThey actually ask my boyfriend and myself who had the better paying job. This embarrassing to my boyfriend, had his first dedi experience ruined. \nThey even started treating him differently after asking who was paying. \nMy  other issue is that out of all the other customers, I was the only one they asked to pay before finishing my treatments. I know this because we where walk-ins and watched several groups come in and go out.	0
Nice decorations and inerior, that's about it. The waitress is not helping at all for selecting good menu. They are charging for hot tea and pepper oil.(I guess they need to do that recover from investing for the interior.) Go ahead cross the street and go to the food court in the mall. They have better service and half lower price for the better food.	0
Horrible service. Horrible food at a high price. Stopped in to try this place for breakfast. Got an egg sandwich with avocado and tomato. This cost me $8.01, after waiting ten minutes too long my order came. After getting to work they had forgotten my tomato. Leaving me question how a $6.40 egg sandwich ended up being a $8.01 piece of garbage. Never again.	0
They did an exceptional job.  My car went in completely filthy and came out virtually spotless and shiny.  I was impressed.\n\nSo, why only one star?\n\nThey stole all of my change that was in the cup holders.  Granted, there was only probably $5 total but still a very shitty thing to do.  \n\nNot coming back.  If you decide to go here, hide yo money.	0
I ordered a sandwich here and it wasn't very good. They also didn't have honey mustard which is just an outrage.	0
Rented a home in summerlin, they wont fix anything. The home was broken into several times they dont care. total con artist slum lords. RUN AWAY! Dont do it!! I held in there for two years, it was honestly the worst experience of my adult life.\n\nTotal Las Vegas Con- There really are far better out there. I have found an amazing Property Management company. Dont do it, seriously.	0
this place sucks! everywhere you go has the smell of cigarette smoke, even in your room! the ceiling was leaking water, ventilation was crap, floors in the room were stained and nasty, and it's a damn maze just to find your room.	0
I agree with the previous posters.  I stopped here when I was in the neighborhood to get gas and there is no pay at the pump.  I had to go inside, tell the woman how much I wanted pumped, show her my ID for the credit card, swipe and then pay.\n\nI will drive by this place in the future.  The set up is just plain dumb and this station aptly earns its name.	0
