My favorite breakfast location in Pittsburgh. Very friendly staff. The breakfast special which is served until 9 am is a great deal.	1
I liked caribou, but I'm really glad Peet's took over the space. The coffee is good, but I really like the selection of teas and the option to have drinks made with almond milk. The matcha tea freddo is nice treat. Also, I've found the staff to be pleasant on all occasions, even at 630 am...	1
Kirk and Susie are superb!  Susie does a great job troubleshooting over the phone.  Kirk is prompt, courteous, professional and always thorough!  I will never use anyone else for my A/C needs	1
Back for a second time and still very pleased. I was craving a meatball and an al\nFresco lunch. I never even noticed the patio in the last visit but it is awesome. It's tucked in between the buildings but doesn't disappoint. There is a giant fireplace, cushy chairs, plenty of umbrellas etc. \n\nI had a tasty meatball sandwich with delightful truffle fries. The fries were not extra oily from being drizzled....instead they were crisp but still truffly! How nice! \n\nI definitely recommend lunch or dinner on the patio. Left happy and craving satiated.	1
So delicious. \n\nService is awesome and unique. \n\nIf you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you're missing out.	1
After a yummy pho lunch I decided to grab some boba tea... Yelp to the rescue! The walls are covered with artwork, writings, and graffiti. I thought it was pretty cool. I ordered a Mango smoothie with boba and was surprised to see them use REAL fruit and not syrup or powder to make it. It was delicious! My cousin had a blueberry smoothie with boba and hers was really good too. I'll defiantly be back	1
The hotel rooms are great, the price affordable, and the halls quiet. Loved the shower and a fan of the toiletries. Desk staff is competent and approachable. \n\nOn site food options are more dorm room fair and the food options in the immediate vicinity are the same. Walk a mile and things open up a bit more.	1
Was wondering....had passed by this location several times and thought I better try it....I did...and was PLEASANTLY surprised!  Got a slice of plain cheese...and it was FRIGGIN DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Best pizza I have had in ages....I'm from New York,..and I must say KUDOS to Joe's New York Pizza!  :)  !!!!  A little pricey... :(  ...but I will still be back ....because good pizza is hard to find in this city!!!  Especially when you are FROM Brooklyn!!!! :)  Thanks Joe's!  :)	1
Super cute bar with no signs so look for the owl!! Eric the bartender is awesome and so sweet!	1
2 words. best bakery! that is all.	1
The best spray tans I have ever had. Everyone that works there made me feel very comfortable and welcomed. Terry is very skilled at spray tanning and pays attention to detail. No streaking or odd orange color. Blends the spray so it looks natural where it meets your palms and feet. I love this place so much that I wait till I get to Las Vegas to spray tan rather than doing it back in my hometown before I leave for vacation. Located across the street from hard rock hotel and casino. Convenient if you are staying there and also worth taking a short cab ride there if you are staying somewhere else in the area. Will be back next time for sure.	1
Nice atmosphere, fantastic service and more importantly flavorful and delicious food! We had the chilling chicken and garlic naan. This is quite possibly the most delicious Indian I have ever had. Highly recommend!	1
I only come here for their waffle fries, love it, yum yum yum.	1
everything is great, from appetizers to the barbeque food, especially their\nmac and cheese real, and the bananna dessert.  Service is great.	1
Great place for family and kids. Penguins and monkeys, birds and fishes.... all under the same roof.	1
Lost in the labyrinth that is Founder's Hall - and in fact not even noticed to most even when you are looking for it - is Booth Playhouse. Many people walk right by since they are in a hurry to catch their show at the Belk, just down the hall. Shame, really, since the Booth is actually a much better venue for many shows.\n\nWhile it is true you cannot stage a full-scale traveling Broadway production there, the intimate spot is great for smaller, generally less well-known shows that can really suck you in because it's like you're almost up on stage. Next time you see something being done at the Booth, you may want to check it out.	1
Service was apathetic and cold. The Beets and Berries salad was ruined by watery dressing that did nothing to lift the flavor of the flavorless ingredients.  The beets were hard. I ate the goat cheese, blueberries, and strawberries, of which none were plentiful. What a waste of money this was.	0
3 dollar roll tacos....way over priced. Total rip off. I get it its mill but damn...i hope people notice other Mexican restaurants. I don't know what's keeping this place open still...	0
First impressions generally tell me what the future will hold ... with this restaurant, it's unremarkable.  I ordered the pineapple fried rice, which is mixed with cashews and shrimp.  The shrimp are tiny and the pineapple is small and few as well.  The whole meal was marginal at best.  There are so many other places to eat in this city.  Skip this place or try their sushi, and go somewhere else.   PS: Service was friendly and affable.	0
I didnt want to be a contrarian, but I did not have a positive experience here, as others have. I ordered a giant pizza well done, and it was anything but. It was soft and mushy and disgusting. Worse still, I emailed them directly but never heard back!	0
This place is certainly unauthentic.. I'm a salvadoran so i can tell you this place is no good..... I Came here recently trying to give them a last chance before deciding to never return..... Well this is what i get ... After having one of their greesy, unacceptable version of a pupusa I got food poisoning ... I spent all night on the bathroom floor crying in pain .... Yeah I'm not returning. By the way PUUSAS ARE NOT FRIED THEY ARE GRILLED!! They just don't make them right here they use too muck oil ! You want real pupusas just hit my grandma up!	0
I love chinese food... I LOVE bars..... I was really excited to try this place today. First, let me compliment the staff. VERY NICE PEOPLE. GREAT SERVICE.\n\nSadly, The food blows. Blows may be strong. Its just beyond average. This place is like Panda Express but with a cool bar.\n\nI don't think you can call this place Gourmet Chinese...	0
Do not go to this place! They did a terrible job! I went there for a pink and white fill and the result looked worse than before i even filled them. They offered to try and cover up their own mistake by painting my nails black. Very embarassing! Left upset &unhappy. Please beware of this place!!!!	0
Ya ya ya i know wtf am i doing staying here.\n\nSo i go into the room.  The shower wall has a HUGE ball of LONG hair stuck to it.\n\nI drop my mascara.  The toilet has PUKE all down the side of it.  \n\nMy best friend stayed here and when she put her key in and opened the door, there was a couple fucking on the bed.\n\nNeed I say more?	0
I usually do a lot of my clothes shopping at this location. Today they were exceptionally unfriendly	0
I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!	0
DO NOT GO HERE!!!! I have been chasing them via phone calls, in person visits, and now through better business bureau to try and get a refund for a terrible job they did, and they won't even respond to that. Looks like I have to take them to small claims court. STAY AWAY if you don't want to go through the hassle that I am having go to go through!	0
I do care about customer service of places, this restaurant has a really good foods but the service was horrible!!!! Me and my friend have to wait 10 min to be greeted for drink and the waiter came back 10 min later just to tell us that they didnt have hot tea..then waited for another 10 min to have somebody take our order... And long time for our foods coming. And they werent that busy, the ladies accross the table who came after us already enjoy the food while we still waiting for our drink.WTF..but the food was very good hope the owner fix the service then it will be best place to go to..	0
This place was ok. Classic drive in burger grub. However it took a good 1/2 hour to get our food. Not cool. Garden burger was satisfactory and the seasoned fries, crisp. I was told the burgers were very fresh and they have tater tots. Just don't expect a quick meal.	0
This place is overrated! I yelped before coming here, and thought I will have a good experience. The masseuse of mine was not putting pressure on my feet, all he did was like rubbing the feet as I was having a shower. He didn't put pressure on them.\nMy friend's masseuse was doing the massage well, yet he is always on his phone. Come on, can't he put his phone down for freaking one hour?! Not coming back here!\n\nAnd as I know, spring mountain has other affordable places!	0
For the love of all that is good and right in the world, why do all of their employees seem to be confused as to the reason they are behind the counter.  Nobody ever seems to know who should be helping customers, and they are almost always busy with other tasks like trying to look busy with other tasks.  I rarely walk out of there not feeling like I rudely interrupted some very important task and I had the nerve to ask them to make me a salad.\n\nThey are close and sometimes I just really like the feeling of being unwanted, you know.  It's the warm fuzzy feeling you get when someone despises you for asking them to do their job.	0
Couldn't get to my regular salon (Elite Nails in Gilbert)  to get a fill (acrylic - pink and white) ... anyway this is on my way home and stopped in.   Horrible job... it was only a fill !!  Staff was not friendly.  Tried to pay with a debit card and got shamed into paying cash (what I had!) told the credit card charged them when I use my card.     \n\nA lesson learned....   but back to my regular place.   Two thumbs down.	0
