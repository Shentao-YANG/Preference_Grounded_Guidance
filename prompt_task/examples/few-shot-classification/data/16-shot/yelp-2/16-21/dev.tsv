This was the best restaurant of our entire post-Labor Day stay!  Try the Expresso Martini - well worth the money.	1
I was excited to see another business take over the spot that Kennedy's held. The decor is what won me over initially and I couldn't wait to try the food. (Fingers crossed it would match the amazing atmosphere)..... Whew! My octopus appetizer was delicious, as was my boyfriend's corn soup (yes, we shared... Kinda. I ate his and he thankfully wouldn't touch my yummy octopus) the heirloom tomato and burrata salad was perfect and his southwest chicken salad had a surprising kick. We will definitely come back again.... Most likely for brunch, which I hear is delicious! Very happy to have this little gem in Henderson!	1
Liked the mojitos!  The pitchers were inexpensive and the food was pretty good.  I think the thai beef salad was my favorite.  \nIf you can, get here in a cab that has a boom box.  Adds to the experience.	1
I loved staying at the Bellagio, it is in the perfect location on the strip and our room was beautifully decorated. Although it was pretty pricey to stay here we had a good time and hopefully we will be back.	1
Pleasant waitress prices are great food was excellent. We have been hete at least 5 times now and when lost for a place to go we end up here.	1
Went there on a night where there were live bands.  Definatley a fan, the crowd and the band gets into everything.  There is also a nother section you can go to if you arent in to the band.  It has a pool table and vidoe games.  The bartenders are pretty hott and are good at paying attention to all of the customers and not getting swamped.  Definatley going to come back here!	1
When I am hungry & don't have time to stop to eat, I hope there is an In-N-Out Burger around! I can fully enjoy their burgers & fries to the fullest WHILE driving because there is no one around to hear me moaning approval with every bite. \n\nBTW, don't worry about my admittal to driving and eating all at once, I am GREAT at multitasking :)	1
I stopped here for the rumored free air. Which held true. The air pump worked fine although it did not have a pressure gauge. Once I went inside the store to purchase a true pressure gauge, I was pleased to find that the store was very well put together and organized. I received customer service from the minute I walked through the door. The store had more than enough staff to cover any influx of customers. Wish there was more of these stores up north.	1
First time staying here. \n\nI was pretty surprised how much I enjoyed it.\n\nThe rooms are nice and clean. The casino has a lot of different games. Bets are not to high.\n\nPerfect location if you want to walk to the Wynn area or if you want to walk to the Paris area. \n\nWould stay again!	1
Don't drive or walk to this restaurant. RUN!!!\n\nWhy? The food here is so good and  the servings so large, you need to burn off calories before consumption because you certainly won't be able to move after eating.\n\nEnough has been said about the food. It's was TERRIFIC!	1
I loved having a Caribou in Oakland and really miss it now that it's gone and replaced with a Peet's :(  It was far superior to the Starbucks and Crazy Mocha nearby.  I'm a true coffee drinker and their black coffee and cold press were both excellent, and they always had some nice single origin whole bean varieties you could buy to take home as well.  It had such a cozy little seating area that was so nice to relax and do work or having a meeting with a colleague or get together for coffee with a friend.  Now that's all changed and I miss have that place there near my office.  I used to hang out there and do work regularly.	1
The place!\nHuge portions, great staff, amazing atmosphere. Every time I go I'm happy. I'm a big guy and I get full. You might need to get a to go box because you might still have food on your plate.\nSteve is the greatest, and he's a giant bodybuilder and you can't miss him.\nI recommend the chicken fried steak, it's  awesome.	1
Had dinner here pretty late tonight. The sky blue ceiling makes you think its day, so you take your time.\n\nFood was pretty good, and Vegas size servings.	1
Pretty cool water park. Pricey for the limited slide options you have but I went on a Sunday and the lines werent so bad, so it was worth my while. Lots of covered lounge chairs. Mist sprayers while your waiting in line. Wristband keys for the lockers was a pretty cool thing. They have a small lazy river if you wanna just chill and lounge in the water (my fave thing to do). Definitely would come again :)	1
I love eating @ this place when they have the all u can eat!! Either Lunch or Dinner!! Me & my friends love going to this place anytime of the day because its open 24 hours!! From Late night after drinking to just plain hungry!! They have great service!! #1 spot to eat Korean BBQ for me!!	1
Again, this is me best memory of Arizona EVER!!!!\nI will forever be grateful for putting smiles on our faces.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/crazyczech?v=app_2392950137#!/video/video.php?v=409760827811	1
The owners changed. This new owner cut the 'half' sandwich size to half the original size. The broccoli and cheddar soup is now so watery not as chunky as before.  They no longer serve coffee either. I wish Jane and her team still ran the place. The new owners are obviously trimming costs everywhere. Well they have lost my business and I will never go to them for my company catering either. A major rip off!	0
Was not impressed. I just moved here and this was the first place I tried. The taper around my ears was crooked. A straight razor was used to clean up my neck, but I could feel spots that were missed at home. He gave me a second mirror to check the back of my hair. I asked him to blend the back a little higher so the style would last longer before looking unkempt. His reply was to run a comb through it and try and convince me it wouldn't. Overall the cut wasn't terrible and the guy was friendly. I am looking for a barber with more care and precision, so I won't be returning to this establishment anytime soon.	0
Their food sucks! Lumpia soggy. The dishes with vegetables in it salty.  And it's expensive.  Even the halo halo isn't so great either.  I'd rather eat at Thelma's. The food there much tastier and cheaper!	0
Collette is super nice but when it came to my lashes.. No matter how many times I went, I was never super happy.  I wanted them super long and thick.. I wanted them to look fake so I can stop wearing fake lashes.. But it just seemed like she didn't want to make them that way. Idk.. She's really nice tho!... And I didn't like having to keep going back every 2 weeks to pay including tip around $100 for the refill.	0
Walked in Saturday evening expecting a great meal. I was recommended to thiz place by a born and raised nuyorican. Reviews show food is phenomenal. Unfortunately I can't agree. We waited at the front door for about 10 minutes and nobody greeted us. The three people in the kitchen kept looking out at us but never nodded or offered any type of acknowledgement. As everyone already seated stared at us waiting to be seated, I noticed every single one of the 8 tables did not have food. Needless to say, after 10 more agonizing minutes of waiting at the front door, 10 we left.	0
Wasn't at all like I remembered.  Only some of the girls were attractive, one had her bf in the audience which made it really awkward for anyone to get a dance from her.\n\nWasn't happy with this time.  Maybe it was a bad night but for a Friday, it sure seemed dead and didn't have the top girls (unless those were then there is a bigger issue).	0
Offering shots to a table of noticeably disgruntled people does not rectify forgetting to put in a food order. Forget the DJ on a Wednesday night, stop letting your waitstaff drink on the job, and just do what you are trying to do-- be a cool looking bar, offer decent food, and make quality drinks.	0
We got the nacho chili cheese hot dog and the planet hollywood polish sausage. The nacho chili cheese was pretty good, especially with the free jalapenos. The planet hollywood sucked, and the funny thing is, we thought that we would like that better since it was a special...wrong. This place is just so so, nothing special really. Also, my bf ended up getting sick after he ate here. We will not be back.	0
Inexpensive but food has no taste. Staff always staring.	0
Sucky ass waiter n bar can't even order more thn a drink at a time on my birthday. Not cool at all!	0
Not worth paying for. Make your own salad better and for less! It was clean- that's about all I can say for it...	0
First timer: hmm I really don't know what to say... Id like to say that I'm serious about waffles... Waffle here are mediocre at best... A little too crumbly for my taste, not really any texture, kinda like a fragile chip more like it... the ice cream sandwich was good BUT if you take  the time to go to LAPPERTS in California hotel, you can get an ice cream sandwich with double/triple the scoop, and a dinner plate size bigger cookie for the same exact price... I really don't understand the hype of this place?	0
May be good for Halloween, otherwise a yard sale in a storefront.	0
how disappointing!\n\nThe dancers are in cheesy lingerie and only 2 are wiggling in the middle of the club.\n\nThe setup is not nice compared to the way they advertise it.\n\nI see A BUNCH OF PEOPLE waiting outside and when I get in there's like barely people and its boring as well.\n\nThey need to rethink some things for this club. starting with LET THE PEOPLE IN. haha. Drinks are weak sauce too for the price you pay.\n\nSave yourself some time. Just because you're at a great expensive snazzy hotel. IT DOES NOT MEAN THEIR NIGHTCLUB IS GOOD!	0
Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then.	0
We saw a bird flying around the restaurant, walking on the furniture and eating crumbs off the tables. When I approached staff, they said the bird lived there and had a nest up in the ceiling. Plus, my husband said the bathrooms were the dirtiest he had ever visited...worse than at some truck stops!	0
